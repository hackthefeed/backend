		"title": "The Matrix, policy edition",
		"content": "Inspired by an insightful comment on LinkeDin from an SC 27 colleague on the other side of the world (thanks Lars!), I spent most of last week updating the SecAware <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/security-policies\">security policy templates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/iso27001\">ISO27k ISMS materials</a>.The main change was to distinguish <b>conformity</b> from <b>compliance</b> - two similar terms that I admit I had been using loosely and often incorrectly for far too long. As I now understand them:<br /><b>Compliance </b>refers to fulfilling binding (mandatory) legal, regulatory and contractual obligations; <br /><b>Conformity </b>concerns fulfilling optional (discretionary) requirements in standards, agreements, codes of ethics <i>etc.</i> It's a fine distinction with implications for the associated information risks, given differing impacts: <br /><b>Noncompliance </b>may lead to legal enforcement action (fines/penalties), other costly sanctions (such as more intrusive monitoring by the authorities and perhaps revocation of operating licenses) and business issues (such as reputational damage and brand devaluation, plus the costs of defending legal action). The consequences of <b>nonconformity </b><i>may </i>be trivial or nothing at all if nobody even cares, but can also involve business issues such as inefficiencies, excess costs and so on, particularly if customers, business partners, the authorities or other stakeholders are seriously concerned at management's apparent disregard for good security practices.Certification of an organisation's ISMS, then, demonstrates its <b>conformity </b>with, not <b>compliance </b>to, ISO/IEC 27001 - well in most cases anyway, where management voluntarily <i>chooses </i>to  adopt and conform to the standard. If they are <i>obliged </i>by some mandatory, legally-binding requirement (an applicable law or regulation, or perhaps terms in a formal contract with a supplier or customer, perhaps due to a law or regulation that pplies to them), I guess they must <b>comply</b>. Putting that another way, nonconformity is an option. Noncompliance isn't.<br />Anyway, having adjusted the terminology and tweaked the SecAware materials, I took the opportunity to prepare two new 'bulk deal' packages - a <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-suite\">comprehensive suite of information security policy templates</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/iso27k-isms-mission\">full set of ISO27k ISMS materials</a>. I'm hoping to persuade customers to spend invest a little more for greater returns. The SecAware policies, for instance, are explicitly designed to work best as a whole, an integrated and coherent suite as opposed to an eclectic collection of policies on various discrete topics. In recent years, I have developed a spreadsheet to track the mesh of relationships between policies:<a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/security-policies\"></a>Yellow blobs on the matrix indicate touch-points between policies, issues of common concern. For example, blobs in the <b>access control policy</b> column mean the policy is related in some way to policies on business relationships, clear desk and screen, cryptography, database security and so on. If, say, a organisation has an <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-on-access-control\">access control policy</a> but currently lacks a policy on the information risk and security aspects of <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-on-business-relationships\">business relationships</a> (<i>e.g.</i> with its Internet and cloud service providers), that <i>may </i>represent a gap in its policy framework unless the access control policy happens to cover business relationship security as well. Likewise with all the other related aspects. While technically it would be possible for the access control policy to cover the lot, in practice that would be 'suboptimal', resulting in an unfocused, unweildy, convoluted and confusing policy, especially if each policy went into detail on related topics.[Trust me, I know. BTDT. Years back I developed an 'Information security policy manual' as a single document. It was a headache to maintain and being about 150 pages, a nightmare to read and understand. The 'policy suite' approach with a collection of topic-specific policies works better for me and our clients.]<br />The relationships are bidirectional, by the way: access control is relevant to business relationship security, and <i>vice versa</i>.<i> </i>That markedly simplifies the matrix since blobs to the right of the black diagonal would be a mirror image of those to the left. The matrix is a surprisingly useful policy management tool, a simple, visual way to maintain the complex relationships between policies in the suite. A few days ago, for instance, I added entries for three new policies on <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/responsible-disclosure-policy\">responsible disclosure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/threat-intelligence-policy\">threat intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/data-masking-and-redaction-policy\">data masking/redaction</a>. Updating the matrix involves determining, for each policy, which related areas are significant enough to merit blobs. It's worth checking that the linked policies don't <i>both </i>cover the same issues, at least not in any detail and especially not in conflicting terms - although, having personally written and regularly maintained these policies for <i>decades</i>, I already have a pretty good idea about what the related policies do and don't say. It's getting harder, though, as the suite approaches 80 topic-specific policies (!) plus 8 <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/aup-acceptable-use-policy-template-pack\"><b>A</b>cceptable <b>U</b>se <b>P</b>olicies</a> and an overarching <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/model-corporate-information-security-policy\">Corporate Information Security Policy</a> and, frankly, I'm getting on a bit.The security architectural objective is to ensure that all relevant policy matters are covered clearly and unambiguously, leaving no significant gaps or overlaps. The policies need to interlock, supporting each other and strengthening the entire control construct. That's important from a governance perspective since policies are a primary mechanism for exerting management direction and control over the organisation.<br />So, there you have it, a Hinson tip for managing a complex mesh of information security or indeed other policies, something worth contemplating at least. I commend it to the house.<br />",

Strategy is perhaps <i>the </i>most difficult and risky part of information risk and security, as it is for other aspects of enterprise management.  If you're still not convinced, consider that <i>not </i>preparing a security strategy and some form of security architecture/design may be even riskier and costlier in the long run. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Maintaining a state of 'creative chaos' - meaning a purely reactive event-driven approach - is suboptimal. However, with no clear objectives in mind, it may <i>seem </i>OK to those in the thick of it, far too busy treading water to scan the horizon for land.  Can I throw you a lifeline?  Google! Study hard. There are tools and techniques to help with strategy and architecture, just as there are for information risk and security management. Seek <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/information-security-consultancy\">professional help</a> if you need it. <br /><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgo-3VlnIW6fyQs75zK_aZiupVtNu7b0UIIojXreb1V5DGXRKdqe8maF9xxbNBpbHRlLodUlAyvOcjiV7TemOcLc87qHByKhzIGWt7C2gQKwr8pgfDmZgNVFNXVcMRQyn45lyh_Nr-yX6K2OhZ7PqkbTKupa7ZzqkrHVMb3l5cb0Pd7QDNo/s1151/Strategy%20sketch.jpg\"></a>You might for instance start simply by (literally!) sketching out whichever areas of information risk and security management matter most to your organisation, exploring the relationships among them and the obvious links with other areas such as IT and HR. Think about the security processes/activities and systems, paying special attention to the organisation's pain points. Gradually refine and extend the rough sketch into a blueprint encompassing broader aspects such as business objectives and resources ... and pretty soon things magically emerge from the mist. <br />Now comes a vital step: debate it with your colleagues. Talk it through. Listen carefully to their questions, objections and concerns, pushing back a little by exploring <i>their</i> strategies, architectures and ideas, steadily refining yours. This is a team game. Take your time.<br /><br />As the vision takes shape, raise the discussion to senior management levels ... and at that point I'll slip quietly away, job done.  Must dash: others adrift, gasping.<br />",

Naturally, they take the opportunity to mention that information security is an integral part of their products. The promo contrasts SOC2 against '27001 certification, explaining why they chose ‘27001 to gain some specific advantages such as GDPR compliance - and fair enough. In the US, compliance is A Big Thing. I get that. <br />It occurs to me, though, that there are other, broader advantages to ‘27001 which the promo <i>could </i>also have mentioned, further valuable benefits of their newly-certified ISMS.<br /><br />I spot at least six <b>general learning points</b> here for organisations currently implementing ISO/IEC 27001: <br /> Elaborating on the broad <b>business benefits</b> of ‘27001 can be a creative and valuable activity in its own right.  A well-designed and effective ISMS can achieve way more than protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, or satisfying GDPR and other compliance obligations.  Although PageProof hints at some, it’s unclear whether they truly appreciate its full potential but chose not to mention them in this promo. <br /><br />The eventual <b>marketing/promotional value</b> of ‘27001 certification is worth thinking-through. From the audience's perspective <i>i.e. </i>the organisation’s third party stakeholders (particularly customers and prospects, plus partners, owners, regulators and other authorities), what worthwhile differences can they expect as a result of the certification?  What are the main points that will truly resonate?  How will successful certification be promoted, and how will it change the organisation’s ongoing marketing, promotional and advertising activities - plus its operations (in order to satisfy if not exceed the market's expectations)? Rhetorical questions such as these may be raised and discussed at any point, ideally starting early-on in the ISMS design and implementation project, and gradually refined in the run-up to certification. <br /><br />Likewise, what about the <b>internal corporate stakeholders</b> - the managers, staff, contractors, consultants, interns <i>etc</i>.: how will the ISMS implementation project affect the workforce? What changes can they expect? What practical differences will the ISMS make? How can they get involved and help the process along (or at least avoid inadvertenly causing problems)? What are the key messages to be put across through internal communications at all stages of the project?<br /><br />Combining points 1-3 can help clarify the <b>objectives </b>of the ISMS - not just the detailed information risk and security objectives but more generally the business objectives, the rationale for doing all this stuff. What are the anticipated payoffs? Which of those benefits would be in, say, the top five?<br /> <br />Those clear objectives, in turn, suggest some obvious <b>metrics </b>to drive their achievement. For example, if 'reducing compliance costs' is one of five key objectives of '27001 certification, there are various ways to measure and control those costs: what would be the ultimate compliance-cost-related metric to track, report and optimise? Congratulations: you've just identified an important security metric - a <b>K</b>ey <b>P</b>erformance <b>I</b>ndicator if you prefer!<br /><br />Certification marks the end of ISMS implementation <i>and </i>the start of routine operations. Once operational, certified and announced to the world, the ISMS should <b>continue adding value</b>, the very reason for its existence. Will any of the business objectives, and hence the metrics and KPIs, change markedly at that point, or will they evolve gradually through business-as-usual? Are there any implications worth taking into account in the ISMS design - for instance, ensuring that the 'security dashboard' can be updated to show new metrics or present KPIs differently? What about 'instrumenting' various security processes and systems now, generating the raw data for historical analysis even though that may not be needed until later on?<br />All in all, six stimulating points drawn from a quick read of a promo. Thanks for the inspiration, PageProof, and congrats on your certification.Oh and there's a free bonus. Point 7: we can all learn stuff from those who go before us. Find out and think about other organisations' approach to information risk, security, privacy, compliance, governance, metrics, incidents, marketing, whatever. Would their strategies be applicable to our organisations? What would we do differently? Could we do even better?<br /><i><b>POSTSCRIPT: </b>if your organisation is so spooky or shy that it wouldn't even consider a press release or displaying its shiny new certificates on a website, you might instead think forward to how certification would be announced internally, conformed to management at least. The things that are important enough to state then are [some of] the key objectives for the ISMS, worth bearing in mind now.</i><i>If it hadn't even occurred to you to promote your eventual certification, I'd have to wonder about your management's understanding and commitment to this initiative, and question your motivation for getting into it. Why bother? What will it achieve, for the business - seriously, what? Isn't that worth celebrating, once achieved?</i><br />",

		"title": "CISO workshop slides",
		"content": "A <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ciso-workshop/the-ciso-workshop\">glossy, nicely-constructed and detailed PowerPoint slide deck by Microsoft Security</a> caught my beady this morning. The title '<i>CISO Workshop: Security Program and Strategy</i>' with '<i>Your Name Here</i>' suggests it might be a template for use in a workshop/course bringing CISOs up to speed on the governance, strategic and architectural aspects of information security, but in fact given the amount of technical detail, it appears to be aimed at informing IT/technology managers about IT or cybersecurity, specifically. Maybe it is intended for newly-appointed CISOs or more junior managers who <i>aspire </i>to be CISOs, helping them clamber up the pyramid (slide 87 of 142):<br />Aside from my gripes with the example metrics (see below), the remainder of the presentation has a lot of useful information, lots of details, plenty of busy, thought-provoking  diagrams and, as I said, an uncommon polish for free slide decks. <br /><br />Here's  a nice, fairly simple example slide that I could happily present and  discuss in some depth as part of a workshop or training course:<br /> Naturally, the slide deck emphasises Microsoft's own 'security posture', such as:IT, cyber and data-centric, virtually ignoring the wider field of <i>information </i>risk and security management (<i>e.g.</i> protecting and exploiting workers' knowledge and other intangible forms of intellectual property) with limited, almost incidental reference to information risk and security management being truly driven by business objectives;Hacking  and malware <i>i.e.</i> deliberate, malicious and often targeted attacks, downplaying accidental  threats (<i>e.g. </i>floods and fires) and other incidents such as human  error, theft, sabotage and fraud, plus enterprise risk management as a whole (<i>e.g.</i> financial risk, market risk, compliance risk, strategic risk ....); <br />Zero-trust - whatever that means to the presenter and audience;Cloud - meaning Azure, specifically;DevOps and DevSecOps - whatever those terms mean ;<br />MS threat intelligence including artificial intelligence/machine learning rapid responses to novel malware (a cool idea, provided it works reliably). <br />I'm intrigued by their choice of example Security Scorecard Metrics (slide 63): <br />These examples supposedly focus on 'continuous improvement' (of what I'm not exactly sure), so let's take a closer look:<b>Business Enablement </b><i>appears </i>to refer to IT and IT security services 'enabling' the business, although '<i>Number of security interruptions in user workflow</i>' implies the need to prevent security getting in the way of business, a curious take on 'enable'.<br /><br /><b>Security Posture </b>suggests a confusing mix of application and account security metrics. I'm really not sure what '<i>security posture</i>' even means in this context, and curious as to why those two aspects in particular have been selected as example metrics. Other slides in the deck appear to equate '<i>security posture</i>' to vulnerability management and software/systems patching - a rather narrow/specific technical concern for metrics suggested to senior management, although arguably it is a major factor in cybersecurity - or to security strategy. Personally, I favour a much broader perspective on the organisation's overall posture (meaning its brands, corporate personality, customer perceptions ...) including security-relevant aspects (<i>e.g.</i> being a trusted partner).  Generally, though, the risk management and security arrangements quietly support and enable the business from the inside, as it were, rather than being exposed externally - unless they fail anyway!<br /><br /><b>Security Response</b>: the example metrics suggest the classical (outdated!) incident-response-and-recovery line <i>i.e.</i> dealing with business <i>dis</i>continuity, although thankfully later slides (#82-85) discuss resilience:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Security Improvement</b> as a category within this set of example metrics all supposedly focused on continuous improvement, confuses me. If these metrics are about improving security, what are the others improving? The example metrics don't help clarify the intent of this category either, referring to 'modernization' and automation (possibly in the realm of security, but not stated), although '<i># of Lessons learned from internal/external incidents</i>' <i>could </i>indicate security improvements <i>provided </i>they are counted rationally (<i>e.g. </i>is an incident relating to weak passwords counted as just one incident or one per account compromised?).For me, <i>continuous improvement</i> implies three things that don't exactly sing out from the example metrics:Clarity on the meaning of 'improve' in the present context, implying the need for management to understand what are the key parameters, as well as being able to measure and control/drive them in a positive direction.<br /><br />Some version of the classic Deming-style Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.<br /><br />Process maturity, leading naturally towards maturity metrics.<br />So, I have concerns about the overall thrust, the categories and the individual metrics offered as examples ... which is ironic given that the very next slide <i>hints</i> at an altogether better approach:How is management supposed to achieve those objectives without the corresponding metrics ... or is the previous slide intended to illustrate the selection of metrics for just one of these bullets? How would the others be measured?  What's more, how were these 'key business outcomes' selected for the slide? What about all the other 'key business outcomes' - of which there are many, <i>especially </i>in any sizeable, mature, complex organisation. Even a tiny micro-business has to juggle numerous objectives simultaneously within its finite resources - a significant information risk right there.<br />All in all, though, it's well worth browsing the slides and thinking about what's included and what's missing, in your own context. In contrast to Microsoft's usual crude in-yer-face full-on marketing, it's a reasonably subtle, well-balanced, comprehensive and interesting presentation. Thank you MS for releasing it. ",

		"content": "<a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-on-it-systems-development-and-acquisition\"></a><br />Prompted by some valuable customer feedback earlier this week, I've been thinking about how best to update the SecAware policy template on software/systems development. The customer is apparently seeking guidance on integrating infosec into the development process, which begs the question \"Which development process?\". These days, we're spoilt for choice with quite a variety of methods and approaches. Reducing the problem to its fundamentals, there is a desire to end up with software/systems that are 'adequately secure', meaning no unacceptable information risks remain. That implies having systematically identified and evaluated the information risks at some earlier point, and treated them appropriately - but how?The traditional <b>waterfall</b> development method works sequentially from business analysis and requirements definition, through design and development, to testing and release - often <i>many </i>months later. Systems security ought to be an integral part of the requirements up-front, and I appreciate from experience just how hard it is to retro-fit security into a waterfall project that has been runnning for more than a few days or weeks without security involvement.A significant issue with waterfall is that things can change substantially in the course of development: the organisation hopefully ends up with the system it originally planned, but that may no longer be the system it needs. If the planned security controls turn out to be inadequate in practice, too bad: the next release or version may be months or years away, if ever (assuming the same waterfall approach is used for maintenance, which is not necessarily so*). The quality of the security specification and design (which drives the security design, development and testing) depends on the identification and evaluation of information risks in advance, predicting threats, vulnerabilities and impacts likely to be of concern at the point of delivery some time hence.<br />In contrast, <b>lean</b>, <b>agile</b> or <b>rapid application development</b> methods cycle through smaller iterations more quickly, presenting more opportunities to update security ... but also more chances to break security due to the hectic pace of change. A key problem is to keep everyone focused on security throughout the process, ensuring that whatever else is going on, sufficient attention is paid to the security aspects. Rapid decision-making is part of the challenge here. It's not just the method that needs to be agile!<br /><b>DevOps </b>and <b>scrum </b>approaches use feedback from users on each mini-release to inform the ongoing development. Hopefully security is part of that feedback loop so that it improves incrementally at the same time, but 'hopefully' is a massive clue: if users and managers are not sufficiently security-aware to push for improvements or resist degradation, and if the development team is busy on other aspects, security can just as readily degrade incrementally as other changes take priority. Another issue is that security testing has to suit short process cycles, with a tendency towards quick/superficial tests and less opportunity for the thorough, in-depth testing needed to dig out troublesome little security issues lurking deep within. Personally, I would be very uncomfortable developing a cryptographic application <i>too </i>quickly, or for that matter anything business- or safety-critical. So, there are some common factors there, regardless of the method:The chosen development methods have risk and security implications; Various dynamics are challenging, on top of the usual security concerns over complexity, and changes present both risks and opportunities;Security  is just one of several competing priorities, hence there is a need for  sufficient, suitable resources to keep it moving along at the right  pace;<br />Progress is critically reliant on the security awareness and capabilities of those involved <i>i.e</i>. the users, designers, developers, testers, project/team leaders and managers. <br />* Just one of those dynamics is that the processes may change in the course of development: a system initially developed and released through a classical waterfall project may be maintained by something resembling the rapid, iterative approaches. The cycle speed for iterations is likely to slow down as the system matures or resources are tight, or conversely speed up to react to an increased need for change from the business or technology.  So, overall, it makes sense for a software/system development security policy to cover:<br />An engineering mindset, prioritising the work according to the organisation's information risks ('risk-first development'?), with a willingness to settle for 'adequate' (meaning fit-for-purpose) security rather than striving in vain for perfection;Flexibility of approach - supporting/enabling whatever processes are in use at the time, integrating security with other aspects and collaborating with colleagues where possible;Sufficient resourcing for the  information risk and security tasks, justified according to their  anticipated value (with implications for metrics, monitoring and  reporting); <br />Monitoring and dynamically responding to changes, being driven by or driving priorities according to circumstances, seizing opportunities to improve security and resisting retrograde moves in order to ratchet-up security towards adequacy. The policy <i>could </i>get into general areas such as accountability (<i>e.g.</i> various process checkpoints with management authorisation/approval), and delve deeper into security architecture (to reduce design flaws), secure coding (to reduce bugs) and security testing (to find the remaining flaws and bugs), plus security functions (such as backups and user admin) ... but rather than bloat <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-on-it-systems-development-and-acquisition\">the SecAware policy template</a>, we choose to leave the details to other policies and procedures. Customers are welcome to modify/supplement the template as they wish.  Whether that suits the market remains to be seen. What do you think? Do your security policies cover software/system development? If so, do they at least address the issues I've noted? If not, <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/policy-on-it-systems-development-and-acquisition\">$20 is a wise investment</a> ...<br />",

For ISO 9001, it is the quality assurance activities designed to ensure that the organisation's products (goods and services) are fit for purpose. For ISO 14001, it is the controls and activities necessary to minimise environmental damage.My point is that the somethings-being-managed are conceptually distinct from the  'management systems' through which managers exert their direction and control. This is a fundamental part of the ISO management systems approach, allowing ISO to specify systems required to manage a wide variety of somethings in a similar way - a governance approach in fact.<br />Management system <b>certification auditors</b>, whose <i>sole purpose </i>is to audit clients' management systems' conformity with the requirements expressed in the standards, have only a passing interest in those somethings-being-managed, essentially checking that they are indeed being actively managed through the management system, thereby proving that the management system is in fact operational and not just a nice neat set of policies and procedures on paper.<br />Management system <b>internal auditors</b>, in contrast, <i>may </i>be given a wider brief by management which <i>may </i>include probing further into the somethings being managed ... but that’s down to management’s decision about the scope and purpose of the internal audits, not a formal requirement of the standards. Management <i>may</i> just as easily decide to have the internal auditors stick to the management system standard conformity aspects, just the same as the certification auditors.Likewise with <b>management reviews </b>of the management systems: the ISO standards stop <i>well </i>short of specifying all the things management might conceivably want to be reviewed. Reviewing conformity with the respective ISO management systems standards is just one of several possible review objectives, alongside all the things hopefully being measured through the <a href=\"https://www.securitymetametrics.com/\">management system metrics</a>.

At the high end are those used for national security and defence purposes, plus safety- and business-critical systems facing enormous risks (substantial threats and impacts). At the low end are systems where the threats are mostly accidental and the impacts negligible - perhaps mildly annoying. Not being able to tell precisely how many steps you've taken today, or being unable to read this blog, is hardly going to stop the Earth spinning on its axis. In fact' mildly' may be overstating it.<br />'Systems' may be servers, desktops, portables and wearables, plus IoT things and all manner of embedded devices - such as the computers in any modern car or plane controlling the engine, fuel, comms, passenger entertainment, navigation and more, or the smart controller for a pacemaker Trust me, you don't want your emotionally disturbed ex-partner gaining anonymous remote control of your brakes, altimeter or pacemaker.In  terms of the layers, we the people using IT are tottering precariously on the top of a house of cards. We interact with application software, interacting with the operating system and, via drivers and microcode, the underlying hardware. A 'secure system' is a load of software running on a bunch of hardware, where the software has been designed to distrust the users and administrators, other software and the hardware, all the way down to, typically, a <b>H</b>ardware <b>S</b>ecurity <b>M</b>odule, <b>T</b>rusted <b>P</b>latform <b>M</b>odule or similar dedicated security device, subsystem or chip. Ironically in relation to RoT, <b><i>dis</i>trust is the default, particularly for the lower layers unless/until they have been authenticated </b>- but there's the rub: towards the bottom of the stack, how can low-level software be <i>sure </i>it is interacting with and authenticating the anticipated security hardware if all it can do is send and receive signals or messages? Likewise, how can the module be <i>sure </i>it is interacting with the appropriate low-level software? What prevents a naughty bit of software acting as a middleman between the two, faking the expected commands and manipulating the responses in order to subvert the authentication controls? What prevents a nerdy hacker connecting logic and scope probes to the module's ports in order to monitor and maybe inject signals - or just noise to see how well the system copes? How about a well-appointed team of crooks faking a bank ATM's crypto-module, or a cluster of spooks figuring out the nuclear missile abort codes?<br />Physically securing the hardware is a start, such that if someone tries to - say - open ('decapsulate') the TPM chip to analyse the silicon wafer under an electron microscope in the hope of finding some secret key coded within, the chip somehow destroys itself in the process - perhaps also the warhead for good measure.  <br />Other hardware/electronic controls can make it virtually impossible for hardware hackers to mount side-channel attacks, painstakingly monitoring and manipulating the module's power supply and ambient temperature in an attempt to reveal its inner secrets. <br />Cryptography is the primary control, coupled with appropriate use of authentication and encryption processes in both hardware and software (e.g.'microcode' physically built-in to the TPM chip's crypto-processor), plus other inscrutable controls (e.g. rate-limiting brute force attacks and, ultimately again, sacrificing itself, taking its secrets with it).Developing, producing and testing secure systems is tough, even with access to low-level debugging mechanisms such as JTAG ports and insider-knowledge about the design. There must be a temptation to install hard-coded backdoors (cheat codes), despite the possibility of 'some idiot' further down the line failing to disable them before products start shipping. There is surely a fascination with attempting to locate and open the backdoors without tripping the tripwires that spring open the trapdoors to oblivion.<br />OK, so now imagine all of that in relation to cloud computing, where 'the system' is not just a physical computer but a fairly loose and dynamic assembly of virtual systems running on servers who-knows-where under the control of who-know-who sharing the global Internet who-knows-how. Having added several extra floors to our house of cards, what could possibly go wrong? That's what <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27070.html\">ISO/IEC 27070:2021</a> addresses. At least, I think so. My head hurts. I may be coming down with vertigo.<br />",

		"content": "Compliance is a concern that pops up repeatedly on the <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/forum.html\">ISO27k Forum</a>, just this  morning for instance. Intrigued by <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html\">ISO 27001</a> Annex A control A.18.1.1 \"Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements\", members generally ask what laws are relevant to the ISMS. That's a tough one to answer for two reasons.  Firstly, I'm not a lawyer so I am unqualified and unable to offer legal advice. To be honest, I'm barely familiar with the laws and regs in the UK/EU and NZ, having lived and worked here for long enough to absorb a little knowledge. The best I can offer is a layman's perspective. I feel more confident about the underlying generic principles of risk, compliance, conformity, obligations, accountabilities, assurance and controls though, and have the breadth of work and life experience to appreciate the next point ...<br />Secondly, there is a <i>huge</i> range of laws and regs that have <i>some </i>relevance to information risk, security, management and the ISMS. The mind map is a brief glimpse of the landscape, as I see it ...<br /><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyFSrzg4j2tOofwY1tnqRNWoZvE6S0rJhW1pP7YcfOs7Xz1AlyUlO54Ejb1jFcTwQDK2DQ6swu2dc24uPO00SpFx8S6FOVvFA0b0QX_OmHqCaI5KdnwN2uuDd3WfjFLNLC3J2WZTC664CqasIrWbcSFXHljLFand88R8v3Pn7nw-SuNXwD/s1424/Comfort%20zone.jpg\"></a>That's a heady mix of laws and regs that apply to the organisation, its officers and workers, its property and finances, its technologies, its contracts, agreements and relationships with employees and third parties including the authorities, owners, suppliers, partners, prospects and customers, and society at large. There are obligations relating to how it is structured, operated, governed, managed and controlled, plus all manner of internal rules voluntarily adopted by management for business reasons (some of which concern obligations under applicable laws and regs). Noncompliance and nonconformity open the can-o-worms still wider with obligations and expectations about 'awareness', 'due process', 'proof' and more, much more.<br />That A.18.1.1 control is - how shall I put it - idealistic:<i>\"All relevant legislative statutory, regulatory, contractual requirements and the organization’s approach to meet these requirements shall be explicitly identified, documented and kept up to date for each information system and the organization.\"</i><i>All </i>requirements?! Oh boy! Explicit! Documented! Maintained! This is bewildering, scary stuff, especially for relatively inexperienced infosec or cybersecurity professionals who seldom set foot outside of the IT domain. We're definitely in the discomfort zone here.<br />At the CISO, Information Security Manager or Privacy Officer level, the view is no less scary despite narrower knowledge gaps. The possibility of being held personally to account (perhaps even sacked or prosecuted!) for incidents involving noncompliance or nonconformity is both sobering and discomforting again.The issue qualifies as a classic information risk, so an obvious risk-response is to attempt to avoid or mitigate it. Unfortunately, simply ignoring it won't make it go away, but large parts of the mind map can legitimately be handed to Other Departments or Someone Else - the Legal/Compliance team for instance (in larger organisations anyway), plus competent professionals from HR, Finance, Sales &amp; Marketing, Operations, plus \"top management\". It's not really about being slopy-shouldered (honest!), so much as acknowledging that legal and regulatory compliance, particularly, deserve/require the involvement of competent specialists. <br />The residual risks may simply be accepted but really they ought to be explored, evaluated and reduced where cost-effective to do so. For example, misunderstandings or disagreements about precisely who is responsible for what in this domain can lead to gaps and conflicts with nasty consequences (<i>e.g. </i>if Everyone assumes Someone Else is dealing with, say, intellectual property) ... and that's a jolly good reason to arrange a management workshop or study to explore the entire mind map, talking it through and carving it up appropriately. Good luck with that.Normally, I argue against <i>unduly</i> narrowing the scope of the ISMS (for instance, constraining it within IT or 'cyber') but in this case, scope-narrowing is due. It makes good sense to steer well clear of the can-o-worms, well skirt around it as best we can anyway.  <br />Fresh off the screen today, I'll soon be dropping the complete mind map one-pager into the <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/iso27k-isms-orbit\">SecAware ISMS Orbit toolkit</a>, complementing the existing security awareness/training materials, diagrams, policies and guidance designed to make your worklife a little less fraught, more tolerable if not entirely comfortable. Meanwhile, if you <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/contact\">ask me nicely and promise not to be scared witless</a>, I'll share the mind map with you. It's R18 rated.<br />",

		"title": "Standards development - a tough, risky business",
		"content": "<a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/\"></a>News emerged during June of likely further delays to the publication of the third edition of <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html\">ISO/IEC 27001</a>, this time due to the need to re-align the main body clauses with ISO's revised management systems template (specfically, the 2022 edition of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1 \"Consolidated ISO Supplement —  Procedure for the technical work — Procedures specific to ISO\",  Annex SL \"Harmonized approach for management system standards\").  Although we already have considerable discretion over which information security controls are being managed within our <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html\">ISO/IEC 27001</a> <b>I</b>nformation <b>S</b>ecurity <b>M</b>anagement <b>S</b>ystems today, an unfortunate side-effect of standardisation, harmonisation, adoption, accreditation and certification is substantial inertia in the system as a whole. It’s a significant issue for our field where the threats, vulnerabilities, impacts and controls are constantly shifting and often moving rapidly ahead of us … but to be honest it’s equally problematic for other emerging and fast-moving fields.  Infosec is hardly special in this regard. Just look at what's happening in microelectronics, IT, telecomms, robotics, environmental protection and globalisation generally for examples. <br />One possible route out of the tar-pit we've unfortunately slid into is to develop forward-thinking ‘future-proof’ standards and release them sooner, before things mature, but that’s a risky approach given uncertainties ahead. It would not be good for ill-conceived/premature standards to drive markets and users in inappropriate directions.  It’s also tough for such a large, ponderous, conservative committee as ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27.  However, the <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27570.html\">smart city privacy standard ISO/IEC TS 27570</a> is a shining beacon of light, with promising signs for the developing security standards on <b>A</b>rtificial <b>I</b>ntelligence and big data security too.  I wish I could say the same of 'cyber', cloud and IoT security but (IMNSHO) the committee is struggling to keep pace with these fields, despite some fabulous inputs and proactive support from members plus the likes of the <b>C</b>loud <b>S</b>ecurity <b>A</b>lliance and NIST.  The floggings will continue until morale improves.<br /><br />Another tar-pit escape plan involves speeding-up the standards development process, perhaps also the promotion, accreditation and certification processes that follow each standard's publication – but again there are risks in moving ahead <i>too</i> fast, compromising the quality and value of the standards, damaging ISO/IEC’s established brands.  SC 27 management appears to be working on just such an approach right now with <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27028.html\">ISO/IEC 27028</a>, putting more time and effort into the informal drafting stages ahead of the formalities of <b>C</b>ommittee <b>D</b>rafts and voting.  The idea is to smooth and speed up the formalities by drafting better standards in the first place, and gaining the committee’s implicit support/consensus ahead of explicit approval.  Likewise with recent moves to separate subject matter expert involvement in the creative preliminary stages from national body involvement in the latter stages.  We’ll see how that turns out! Personally, I <i>yearn </i>for modern, collaborative, cloud-based methods, particularly for the early informal stages of each standard. I'm sure we could get a lot more done, relatively quickly and painlessly, by working together online as a group in near-realtime ahead of the necessary ISO formalities around proofreading and approval. At the very least, more productive social dialogue between the experts would help get us all to the same chapter, if not on the same page. Committee meetings, whether virtual or in person, are costly and ponderous compared to, say, Google Groups or Microsoft Teams. I see these as complementary not alternatives, not either-or but both-and.<br /><br />Yet another tar-mitigation option would be for SC 27 leadership to clarify the strategy and (re)align the committee members accordingly, increasing their understanding and support for whatever it takes to optimise the processes. However, ‘leadership’, ‘strategy’, 'alignment’ and 'optimisation' are all difficult in the ISO context, given the importance of due process, ample consideration, cultural awareness, diplomacy and global consensus.  Management has cats to herd, guide, persuade and convince rather than unilaterally pushing through or blocking changes (as happens occasionally).  Governance is challenging at the best of times: in such a large, international, busy, largely voluntary and diverse organisation, it’s tough-as. <br />Looking back, despite all the challenges and all that tar, SC 27 has been <i>remarkably </i>successful, generating and managing a <a href=\"https://www.din.de/en/meta/jtc1sc27\">sizeable portfolio</a> of well-respected ISO27k, privacy and other infosec standards. Sure, it could have done better in some areas, but overall the world is in better shape today than it would otherwise have been without SC 27.<br /><br />Meanwhile, aside from shouting a few choice phrases from the touchline, is there anything <i>we </i>can do to help? <br />As we gain knowledge and expertise, we can give something back. Volunteer as subject matter experts, actively engaging with SC 27 through our national standards bodies to help develop better, more forward-thinking standards, for example by contributing to, reviewing and commenting on draft standards, especially in the early, more creative stages of the drafting process;Propose, draft and offer possible new ISO27k standards, as is currently happening with, say, <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/attributes\">security control attributes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/professional-services-information-security-guideline\">professional services</a>; Collaborate more, pulling together as a <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/forum.html\">supportive community</a> to develop, understand, adopt and extract value from the standards;Think <i>beyond </i>mere certification. Be more creative and innovative, treating the standards as foundational platforms, suggested good practices worth considering, adapting, adopting and building upon rather than targets, hurdles or constraints on progress (as is happening right now with ISO/IEC 27001);Be open to novel approaches, such as integrated management systems, peer-group and collaborative working, and cherry-picking whichever approaches hold the most promise for achieving our organisations' business objectives (<i>e.g.</i> supplementing or completely replacing the current '27001 Annex A controls with a more contemporary mix);<br />Be more tolerant and considerate of each other, including ISO/IEC, SC 27's management and editorial teams, the accreditation and certification bodies, auditors plus our work and professional colleagues. Remember, we're all on the same side here!  ",

What, exactly, are we supposed to be inventorying?<br /> <br />The standard refers repeatedly but enigmatically to \"information and other associated assets\" that an organisation’s <b>I</b>nformation <b>S</b>ecurity <b>M</b>anagement <b>S</b>ystem protects. The intended meaning of 'information asset' has been a bone of contention within ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 for <i>years</i>, some experts and national bodies vehemently disagreeing with each other until, eventually, a fragile ceasefire was declared in order to move forward on the numerous standards projects that hinge on the term.  Currently, '27002 provides a rather broad and unhelpful definition of \"asset\" as \"anything that has value to the organisation\" - paperclips, for instance, fall within the definition. Does that mean your ISMS should protect paperclips since, arguably, they are 'associated with information', albeit very low value assets. I know this is <i>reductio ad absurdam</i> but it illustrates the tar pit that SC 27 found itself in.<br /><br />On a more pragmatic note, I have consciously taken a wide view of information assets in preparing a <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/information-asset-checklist\">checklist of information assets</a> for SecAware. I intend to set you thinking about the potential scope, purpose and focal points of your ISMS. You may feel that certain items on the checklist are irrelevant ... or the checklist might just open your eyes to entire categories of valuable information that you hadn't even considered. Whether they end up in or out of scope of your ISMS is for you and your management colleagues to determine. I'm simply giving you food for thought. <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/information-asset-checklist\"></a><i><b>Click the image for instant access!</b></i><br />",

Even within the context of the standard, it's still somewhat unclear, verging on cryptic.Luckily for us and the certification auditors, there's more helpful advice elsewhere.<br /><a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27003.html\">ISO/IEC 27003</a> offers a page of 'guidance on formulating an information security risk treatment plan (6.1.3 e))', which I won't quote in full but summarise and critique here:The <b>RTP </b>documents the outputs from '27001 clause 6.1.3 a) through c) ... <br />... meaning the selection of 'appropriate information security risk treatment options' <i>and</i> a check against Annex A to 'verify that no necessary controls have been omitted';Even with the '27001 corrigendum, the revised wording of this clause remains problematic and contradictory, implying that Annex A is at once both a complete ('comprehensive') and an incomplete ('not exhaustive') list of possible/suggested/recommended/required controls;Users and auditors of the standard may disagree on their interpretations of the requirement, leading to tears at bed time;The forthcoming new edition of ISO/IEC 27001 improves but may not totally resolve the ambiguity.  We'll see.<br />For each [identified, evaluated and] treated [information] risk, the <b>RTP </b>records the:Selected treatment option(s);Presumably meaning that the <b>RTP </b>should state, for every identified risk, that it is to be avoided, mitigated, shared and/or accepted;An example in the standard mentions that a control may  'change the likelihood, or change the consequences of the risk' - as if that helps!  Is that another aspect also to be recorded in the <b>RTP </b>or an alternative to avoid/mitigate/share/accept?;Since risks cannot be totally eliminated in practice, some residual risk is inevitable and must be accepted - so should that be recorded against every single risk, or against a separate high-level entry for 'risks relating to the ISMS and risk management process'?<br />Necessary control(s);Where both 'controls' and 'necessary' are decidedly ambiguous. 'Controls' is generally taken to mean something similar to those in '27001 Annex A - basically a set of succinct one-liners rather than detailed descriptions such as the page or so expanding on each 'control' in <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27002.html\">ISO/IEC 27002</a>;<br />'Necessary' generally means something like 'relevant, appropriate and hence a valuable means to mitigate one or more unacceptable information risks' - unless a jobsworth auditor doggedly <i>insists </i>that every single control in Annex A (and perhaps others of his/her own invention) is 'necessary' until he/she can somehow be convinced otherwise.<br />Implementation status. Yet another ambiguous phrase! The wording <i>implies </i>a neat binary measure <i>i.e. </i>each control is either implemented or not implemented. Things are not always so clear-cut in practice, more analogue than binary with controls being partially implemented, in the process of being implemented, in the process of being retired/removed, of uncertain status <i>etc</i>.Plus there's the added question of whether even fully implemented controls are in fact effectively mitigating the risks as intended: are they in use, active, working properly, generating value for the organisation and earning their keep? How would anyone determine that, or gain assurance? <br />There's a naughty little cluster of potentially nasty concerns lurking behind 'implementation status' which the standards, and the <b>RTP</b>, largely ignore, presumably for the sake of the poor certification auditors who are expected not just to interpret the language but use it to test for conformity.<br />'27003 tells us the <b>RTP </b>can include other useful content <i>i.e</i>.:<br />Risk owner(s);Casually hinting at what <i>can </i>be a very useful governance approach and risk management mechanism - except the hint is so subtle as to be easily overlooked. <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27000.html\">ISO/IEC 27000</a> defines risk owner as a \"person or entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk\" - one of the precious few ISO27k mentions of accountability; andExpected residual risk after the implementation of actions. Errrrr, how are we meant to state this in the <b>RTP</b>? Obviously, we <i>expect </i>risks to be mitigated (reduced) or stabilised by the controls, but by how much?What if the residual risk is still unacceptable - what then? What if the residual risk remains uncertain, just as the true implementation status is uncertain? What if the presumption that a control is 'maintaining' the risk turns out to be unfounded?There are fundamental problems here due to the very nature of 'risk'.<br />'27003 even indicates/suggests a tabular format and content of the <b>RTP</b>: <br />The word 'plan' in <b>RTP </b>clearly implies an <i>intention </i>to treat identified and evaluated information [security] risks at some future point ... but: When? Who? How? In what manner? To what extent? If the 'plan' is, in reality, merely a vague suggestion with no real substance to it, no resources, no schedule, no management approval <i>etc</i>., does it have any credibility at all?Even if there is a budget line item, an initiative, a project, a to-do list or whatever, it is still just a plan: jam tomorrow. Free beer next week. Trust me, nirvana is just around the corner - or, as we Kiwis say, \"She'll be right\", sometimes followed by \"Yeh, right\". Is it reasonable for the <b>RTP</b> to state that a significant and patently unacceptable information risk is to be accepted and not mitigated for, say, at least a year? Technically, if that's what management decides having followed the proscribed risk management process, the certification auditors' unease is not sufficient grounds for raising a nonconformity. <br />The ISMS management reviews, internal audits, certification and surveillance audits <i>could </i>usefully check progress against the <b>RTP</b>, hopefully generating assurance that the <b>RTP </b>is actually being executed and completed more or less as intended except that is presently neither suggested or required by the standards, unfortunately - an opportunity lost, I say. Yes, I appreciate it would be tricky to specify the requirements and could lead to yet more effort and expense on assurance, but the focus and pressure on putting plans into action and meeting deadlines would be worthwhile IMNSHO.As to other standards:The current 2018 release of <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27005.html\">ISO/IEC 27005</a> doesn't even <i>mention </i><b>RTP</b> - not once! Even 'risk treatment' only appears twice, in an annex quoting from ISO 31000 (see below). <br />In stark contrast, the forthcoming new 2022 edition of '27005 offers a much more sensible 2½ pages of <b>RTP</b> advice, mostly under clause 8.6.  The purpose of formulating the <b>RTP</b> is 'to create plan(s) for treating specific sets of the risks that are on the list of prioritized risks'.Hmmm, that's a bit self-referential and, anyway, what are those 'specific sets of the risks' and how are risks prioritised? Subclause 7.4.2 refers to prioritisation as 'considering assessed levels of risks' which sort of makes sense. Although I haven't spotted any mention of those 'specific sets of the risks' in '27005, <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27007.html\">ISO/IEC 27007</a> talks of mitigating some risks with sets of related controls: maybe that's a clue - or is that a separate concern? <br />The <b>RTP </b>is 'a plan to modify risk such that it meets the organization's risk acceptance criteria'.Fair enough, although the standard doesn't actually explain how those risk acceptance criteria might be determined/specified by the organisation.The implementation guidance under '27005:2022 subclause 8.6.1 will include this gem:  <br />Nicely put! 'Design plan' <i>hints</i> at the organisation having developed an information risk and security architecture. Good move, although personally as a fan of security engineering I'd have preferred an explicit mention and further guidance on that.<br />The expansive German infosec standard <a href=\"https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html\">IT-Grundschutz</a> talks of the <b>RTP</b> in terms of a project plan.<br /><a href=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:31000:ed-2:v1:en\">ISO 31000</a> describes risk treatment in clause 6.5 as involving 'an iterative process of:Formulating and selecting risk treatment options; Planning and implementing risk treatment;Assessing the effectiveness of that treatment;Deciding whether the remaining risk is acceptable;If not acceptable, taking further treatment.'Such iterations have implications for the <b>RTP</b>. For one thing, it should be seen as a dynamic, flexible, living plan showing a bunch of things currently in progress as well as those yet to start and perhaps those already completed. After due analysis and consideration, information risk and security-relevant changes (such as novel threats or attack modes, newly-disclosed vulnerabilities and new legal, regulatory or contractual obligations) may well require updates to the <b>RTP</b> (<i>e.g</i>. adjusting the relative priorities, resourcing and deadlines for planned activities). Any reviews or audits, therefore, should not expect or require the <b>RTP </b>to be static or complete. Some latitude is appropriate. Loose ends are <i>likely </i>to be dangling.Potentially every treatment for every identified information risk needs to be formulated, selected, planned, (approved, funded and) implemented, assessed (somehow) for 'effectiveness', and evaluated, then sent back around the loop if the residual risk is unacceptable. For just about any organisation, that's an <i>enormous </i>amount of planning and work if done thoroughly ... which, arguably, is appropriate given that, in theory, even small gaps or weaknesses in our information security arrangements render us liable to incidents. In practice, however, it is unreasonable to expect such a thorough, detailed approach. Most managers would consider it red tape, not cost-effective and hence inappropriate and unjustified. A more realistic business-like approach involves prioritising the more significant risks with higher probabilities and/or impacts for detailed analysis and explicit treatment, while tackling lesser risks by other means such as generic/baseline security controls plus incident management and business continuity arrangements to cope with any incidents that do occur if and when residual risks materialise.Section 6.5.1 of  '31000 offers further useful guidance on the <b>RTP</b>:That's a lot more detail than most <b>RTP</b>'s  I've seen or written so far, more akin to a project or program plan -  suggesting that organisations could simply use their usual  project/programme management methods rather than an <b>RTP</b>, at least for the initial ISMS implementation phase. Once the ISMS is operational, I'm not convinced something called an <b>RTP</b> would add value to the routine, iterative information risk management  activities aside from satisfying the requirement of the standard and the  conformity assessment criteria. So, as far as I'm concerned, feel free to stamp \"<b>RTP</b>\" on whatever risk management documents you currently use!<br />That still leaves open the possibility of developing an <b>RTP</b> of the other kind mentioned in the forthcoming fourth edition of '27005, namely a 'design plan' or security architecture. Now <i>that's</i> an intriguing thought ... OK, that's enough for today. I'm done. Topic discussed. Grey matter stimulated. Axes ground and honed to a razor's edge. Time to get outside and enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/06/21/explainer-what-is-matariki-and-why-is-it-our-newest-holiday/\">first matariki public holiday</a> here in NZ. Mind you, I'm tempted to prepare a guideline about the <b>SoA</b> and <b>RTP</b>, supporting the existing templates and elaborating on the security architecture, for the <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/iso27001n\">SecAware ISMS toolkits</a> - maybe next week. <br /> ",

The sequence could be improved upon, although I'm not sure what kind of conceptual structure would make most sense: more coffee required!In due course I'd like to contribute to the ISO/IEC 27000 revision project which intends to introduce a new clause around 'security principles'.

		"content": "Following its exit from the EU, the UK is having to pick up on various important matters that were previously covered by EU laws and regulations. One such issue is to be addressed through a new law on online safety.\"Online safety: what's that?\" I hear you ask.  \"Thank you for asking, lady in the blue top! I shall elaborate ... errrr ...\"'Online safety' sounds vaguely on-topic for us and our clients, so having tripped over a mention of this, I went Googling for more information. First stop: the latest amended version of the <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0121/220121.pdf\">Online Safety Bill</a>. It is written in extreme <b>legalese</b>, peppered with <b>strange terms </b>defined in <b>excruciating detail</b>, and <b>littered </b>with internal and external <b>cross-references</b>, hardly any of which are hyperlinked e.g.Having somewhat more attractive things to do on a Sunday than study the bill, a quick skim was barely enough to pick up the general thrust. It <i>appears </i>to relate to social media and search engines serving up distasteful, antisocial, harmful and plain dangerous content, including (\"but not limited to\") porn, racist, sexist and terrorist materials. Explaining that previous sentence in the formal language more becoming of law evidently takes <b>230 </b>pages, of the order of 100,000 words. <br />Luckily for us ordinary mortals, there are also <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0004/en/220004en.pdf\">explanatory notes</a> - a brief, high-level summary of the bill, explaining what it is all about, succinctly and yet eloquently expressed in plain English with pictures (not). The explanatory notes are a mere <b>126 </b>pages long, half the length of the original with another 40-odd thousand words. Simply explaining the explanatory notes takes half a page for starters: So, the third bullet suggests that we read the 126 pages of notes PLUS the 230 page bill. My Sunday is definitely under threat. At this point, I'm glad I'm not an MP, nor a lawyer or judge, nor a manager of any of the organisations this bill seems likely to impact once enacted. I'm not even clear which organisations that might be. Defining the applicabilty of the law - including explicit exclusions to cater for legitmate journalism and free-speech - takes a fair proportion of those 346 pages.Despite not clearly expressing the risk, the bill specifies mitigating controls - well, sort of. In part it specifies that OFCOM is responsible for drawing up relevant guidance that will, in turn, specify control requirements on applicable organisations (to be listed and categorised on an official register, naturally), with the backing of the law including penalties. Since drafting, promoting and enforcing the guidance is likely to be costly, the bill even allows for OFCOM to pass (some of) its costs on to the regulated organisations, who will, in turn, pass them on to users. A veritable cost-cascade.<br />As to the actual controls, well the bill takes a classical risk-management approach involving impact assessments and responses such as taking down unsafe content and banning users who published it. There are arrangements for users to report unsafe content to service providers, plus automated content-scanning technologies, setting the incident management process in motion. <br />The overall governance structure looks <i>roughly </i>like this:No wonder it takes &gt;100,000 words to specify that little lot in law ... but, hey, maybe my diagram will save a thousand, a few dozen anyway.<br />You're welcome.<br />The reason I'm blabbering on about this here is that I'm still quietly mulling-over a client's casual but insightful comment on Thursday. \"<i>I was wondering whether</i> [the information security policies we have been customising for them] <i>might be a little too in depth for our little start-up.</i>\" Fair comment! Infosec <i>is </i>quite involved and - as you'll surely appreciate from this very blog - I tend to focus and elaborate on the complexities, writing profusely on topics that I enjoy. I find it quite hard to explain stuff simply and clearly without first delving deep, particularly if the end product doesn't suit my own reading preferences.Looking at the policies already prepared, I had cut down our <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/security-policies\">policy templates</a> from about 3 or 4 pages each to about 2, adjusting the wording to reflect the client's business, technology and people, and removing bits that were irrelevant or unhelpful in the context of a small tech business. But, yes, I could see how they might be considered in-depth, especially since, even after combining a few, there were 19 policies in the suite covering all the topics necessary. <br />So, I responded to the client's point by preparing a custom set of <b>A</b>cceptable <b>U</b>ser <b>P</b>olicies to supplement the more traditional topic-based policies already prepared. I set out with our AUP templates - single-sided A4 leaflets in (for me!) a succinct style - laying out the organisation's rules for acceptable and unacceptable behaviours in topic areas such as malware, cloud and IoT. The writing style is direct and action-oriented, straight down-to-business. Modifying the AUP templates for the client involved trivial changes such as incorporating their company name in place of 'the organisation', and swapping-out the SecAware logo for theirs. A little trimming and adaptation of the bullet points to fit into half a side per topic took a bit more time but, overall, starting with our templates was much quicker and easier than designing and preparing the AUPs from scratch.I took the opportunity to incorporate some eye-catching yet relevant images to break up the text and lead the reader from topic-to-topic in a natural flow.<br />I merged the AUP templates into one consolidated document for ease of use, and prepared additional AUPs on areas that weren't originally covered (security of email/electronic messaging and social media), ending up with <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/aup-acceptable-use-policy-template-pack\">a neat product</a> that sums things up nicely in 11 topic areas. It can be colour printed double-sided on just 3 sheets of glossy A4 paper to circulate to everyone (including joiners), or published on the corporate network for use on regular desktop PCs, laptops or tablets.<br />So far, so good ... but then it occurred to me yesterday that if the AUPs are to be readily available and accessible by all, the client could do with a 'mobile' version for workers' smartphones. Figuring out the page size, margins and formatting for mobiles, and further simplifying/trimming the content to suit small, narrow smartphone screens with very limited navigation took me another hour or two, ending up with a handy little document that looks professional, is engaging and reads well, makes sense <i>and</i> provides useful guidance on important information security matters. Reeeeesult!<a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/acceptable-use-policy-aup-template-mobile-edition\"></a> <br />In recognition of the client's valuable suggestion that sparked this, we won't be charging them for the AUP work - it's a bonus. The client gets a nice set of policies well suited to their business and people, while we have <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/acceptable-use-policy-aup-template-mobile-edition\">new products gracing the virtual shelves of our online store</a>, a win-win. Happy days.<b>A <a href=\"https://www.secaware.com/product-page/acceptable-use-policy-aup-template-mobile-edition\">bargain</a> at just $20!</b><br />Now, about that Online Safety Bill: would anyone like to commission a glossy leaflet version in plain English, complete with pretty pictures?<br />",

		"title": "Risk management trumps checklist security",
		"content": "While arguably better than  nothing at all, an unstructured approach to the management of information security results in organisations adopting a jumble, a  mixed bag of controls with no clear focus or priorities and – often –  glaring holes in the arrangements. The lack of structure indicates the absence of genuine  management understanding, commitment and support that is  necessary to give information risk and security due attention - and sufficient resourcing - throughout the business.  It's hard to imagine <i>anyone </i>considering such a crude, messy approach adequate, even those who coyly admit to using it!  I'm not even sure it qualifies as 'an approach'.<br /> Anyway, the next rung up the ladder sees the adoption of a checklist approach: essentially, someone says 'Just adopt these N controls and you'll be secure'! It may be true that some information security controls are more-or-less universal, so any organisation that does not have them all might be missing out. Maybe it <i>is </i>a step up from the previous approach, and yet there are significant issues with checklists that tend to be:Basic, severely over-simplifying a complex and dynamic problem, ignoring numerous aspects while focusing attention on the N (meaning a handful);Generic but not necessarily as universal as implied, given the wide diversity of organisations out there in terms of size, maturity, industry, culture, history, business objectives, resources and so on;The 'lowest common denominator', setting a (very) low bar;Sequenced linearly in a way that implies priorities for implementation and generally disregards dependencies and linkages between items on the list, yet another over-simplification;  <br />Just someone's arbitrary selection, generally without any sound basis for selecting the listed controls and not others, other than the origantor's alleged expertise;Tricky to interpret and apply in a given situation, given the immaturity of the organisations attracted to checklist approaches; <br />Not sufficient in most cases, and often biased towards particular types of control <i>e.g.</i> 'cyber' or 'compliance';Unrealistic in the presumption that simply because someone recommends the N controls, managers will therefore naively accept that they are both required and valuable;Belittling, clearly implying that they are deliberately dumbed-down because the intended audience is, well, dumb.<br />If N controls are inadequate or even barely sufficient, it is tempting to expand the list. N-plus control checklists suffer similar problems, plus:The more controls that are added to the list, the less likely they are to be truly universal;The controls tend to be grouped and structured in some fashion ... which is another ill-defined process involving arbitrary criteria and of dubious value;<br />The longer the list, the less attractive it becomes to those seeking easy solutions. Simply reading longer lists takes time and becomes tedious, while implementing all the controls appears increasingly arduous - especially if the recommended controls are not explained and justified properly (which would make the list even longer anyway!);Ultimately, a long list is no better than a bit of Googling, consideration and discussion;There is a risk that the very readers who would benefit to some extent from the approach are overwhelmed by it all and put off entirely.At face value, <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html\">ISO/IEC 27001</a> is an N-plus checklist, after all Annex A is an arbitrarily structured list of about 100 information security controls recommended by a committee of experts. There's more to it than that, however.<br />For one thing, Annex A is merely a succinct summary of the information security controls in <a href=\"https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27002.html\">ISO/IEC 27002</a>. It's a simple list, yes, but one backed by roughly a page of detailed explanation behind each control,  particularly in the latest, fully updated edition published a few months back. <br />Furthermore, the main body of ISO/IEC 27001 avoids the checklist mentality by defining the governance arrangements for managing an organisation’s information risks. It is a systematic, iterative, risk-driven approach, simple and easy to grasp. In a nutshell, there are just 4 phases:<br /><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNmbA6s2ws9WsQq68aVQUPgancYCH24xy1k-aeonw62IkXmgjU3OdH8ikh3LKCnmAJ0vZtgrSCG6Rn9fzCVfzWHDt1GOAJ6LoeVNc6evTYrawMa4_jPBA7CS_6V7fpVYgyNHnevEa9WO1eyInEh89Dlk-EPGx5wFSt3USGO-3fLXn9qTKl/s1169/RISK%20mnemonic.jpg\"></a><br />An ISO27k ISMS enables and supports the  analysis, prioritisation and changes required for <i>any </i>organisation to  design and implement a sound, systematic approach to information risk  and security management <i>that is tailored and appropriate to its specific situation</i> - a substantial enhancement over any crude checklist. The selection and implementation of information security controls is context-dependent in ISO27k, particularly as the standard allows organisations to choose controls from any source - including those crude checklists, and Google, and ... whatever. Any list of controls is less important than the <i>process</i> for identifying, evaluating and treating risks<i>. </i><i> </i>The risk management process at the heart of ISO/IEC 27001 is universally applicable. It's not even limited to information risks, information security, privacy and so forth.<i><br /></i> <br />Organisations may wish to go <i>beyond </i>the fairly basic risk and security management arrangements mandated in the main body of ISO/IEC 27001 … but that is not necessarily a good idea, especially at the start of their journey to maturity.   ‘Keep it simple’ makes more sense as a strategy, especially in a start-up situation <i>i.e. </i>set out to implement just the basics, get them working properly and plan to build gradually from there, over time, making incremental improvements where justified or necessary. The ISMS itself embodies the mechanisms to capture requirements and push through improvements, systematically (see the K in the RISK mnemonic).  <br /><br />A reasonably mature organisation is likely to have a suite of reasonably mature management and governance arrangements already operating. A new ISO27k ISMS will be slotting in to and making use of them, requiring changes in various aspects to accommodate the structured, systematic, risk-driven ISO27k approach. The ISMS itself is likely to involve consolidating existing practices around information and cyber security management, albeit often mostly within IT but hopefully with strong lateral links to related functions such as Risk, Compliance, Procurement, HR, Operations and Facilities, perhaps even upwards to senior/Executive Management and the Board.  Even here, the keep-it-simple ISMS strategy has value in terms of focusing on the essential/core processes and activities around information risk management. Anything above and beyond the core should probably be a lesser priority during the initial ISMS implementation phase, unless there are good business reasons to press ahead more urgently in other areas (<i>e.g.</i> compliance obligations) – in which case those pressures can help drive through the ISMS implementation. <br />",

Hackers can easily access your confidential information while you are online, and your sensitive data could end up being sold to third parties or used in phishing schemes against you. Luckily, there are many things you can do to increase your safety while surfing on public Wi-Fi networks to protect yourself from harm.

By changing these default names, you can reduce the risk of being tracked by hackers while browsing online. Use a secure Wi-Fi network It can be tempting to instantly connect your phone or computer to an open Wi-Fi network when you are active. Unfortunately, most public Wi-Fi networks are full of security risks. If you do not want your personal information exposed, it is best not to use these networks at all—or only use them in a pinch.

		"content": "Undoubtedly, Google Chrome is the most popular web browser, holding the highest market share. But Mozilla Firefox is close enough. In 2022, Firefox was the third most popular web browser, holding a market share of 4.92%. In other words, Firefox is an excellent alternative to Google Chrome. However, although Firefox has many standalone features, it does not mean it is immune to errors. One of the most common errors you will likely encounter when using Firefox is the ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap error. This error could be frustrating and significantly hinder users’ browsing experiences. What is SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP Error It is essential to understand that the ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap error only happens with Firefox, no other browser. The error occurs when Firefox fails to obtain the necessary security data from a website you are trying to access. Usually, the error occurs when a user tries to access an old website without up-to-date SSL protection. Older versions of SSL certificates that users used before have been scrapped off because of security concerns. But suppose a website uses the old version of the secure socket layer certificate with an outdated encryption cipher. In that case, Firefox will not allow users to use such a website as it might easily compromise their security and privacy. How Do I Fix the SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP Error As frustrating as seeing this error might be, users should know that the error is designed to protect them from visiting websites that are vulnerable to attackers.

From operating systems to antivirus software, to cloud services, to hardware devices, virtually none of the technology we use is static. And with these updates come side effects and problems that sometimes take a while to get fixed.I recently found an interesting bug that hasn’t gotten a lot of attention when I purchased a Lexmark multi-function printer. As part of the installation process, I went online to download the latest printer driver. (I always recommend going to a vendor website to grab the latest drivers because, after all, the latest software should have the latest fixes, right?) I was able to set up the printer to print, scan, and electronically fax and figured I was done for the day.<a href=\"/article/3689155/software-bugs-that-bug-me-and-how-to-swat-them-down.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

		"content": "Public Key Cryptography (PKC) or Asymmetric Cryptosystems – ever heard about this cryptography (data encryption) method? This cryptography method involves two non-identical, but mathematically linked keys. One key is used to encrypt the data and is termed the public key, whereas the other key is used to decrypt the data and is termed the private key. The public key is shared amongst multiple users for encrypting the data. The private key on the other hand is secretly stored by the recipient of the data. The recipient can use this key to decrypt the information and read the message. Asymmetric cryptography is more preferred in the modern era than symmetric cryptography, wherein only one key is used in the entire encryption and decryption process. SSL Certificates &amp; Public Key Cryptography: Public keys are too huge and hence sharing them is a tough task, since they are difficult to remember. Hence, these keys are placed on SSL certificates, for secured communication as well as easy sharing. The private key which is also named the secret key is never shared with anyone. Its either stored in the user’s operating system, any software, or any external hardware (USB token) and is used for decrypting the ciphertext. PKC is mostly used in SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layers/Transport Layer Security) certificates, which are issued by reputed Certificate Authorities (CA). When these security certificates are installed on the website, they show their presence in the form of HTTPS (hyper-text transfer protocol secure) in the URL and a padlock … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/what-is-public-key-cryptography\">Continue reading \"What is Public Key Cryptography?\"</a>",

Security awareness training teaches your colleagues how to practice good security habits and reduces the risk of a security breach. But at the end of the day, the kind of training you can give your colleagues often comes down to what your budget allows. In this blog post, we use data to explain why security training is well worth the upfront cost. For example, did you know that organisations have about a 30% chance of experiencing a security breach in the next two years? Or that using security training reduces the security cost of an employee by 52%? </em> \n<em>We’ll go over training costs, the consequ</em><em>ences of security breaches, and the average ROI of training.

But even if you are following a pristine protocol, have offered training to employees, repeatedly remind staff to verify suspicious communications, and keep up on the latest nefarious campaigns to fool the unwary, your organization is, and always will be, vulnerable.<a href=\"/article/3690511/6-reasons-why-your-anti-phishing-strategy-isn-t-working.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

While of course each developer is a unique individual, there are some common personas I have come across in my work with development teams. In fact, as a developer in prior jobs, I have embodied some of these traits myself. Let’s dive in.\nThe Competitor\nThis is a developer who feels they know more and do more than their peers, and they want everybody to know that this is the case. These individuals want to be acknowledged as a top contributor and expert, and they treat their work as an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities. \nI remember one team ran a scan using an open-source security tool. The scan uncovered around 500 vulnerabilities. The competitive developer took it upon themself to go off, work extra hours and weekends, and single handedly resolve each vulnerability. \nTo engage the competitor, you can try to rollout…",

		"content": "JavaScript is a programming language based on prototypes instead of classes. When a new object is created, the features of the prototype object are inherited – this includes arrays, functions, and even class definitions. The new object can also act as a template for other inheriting objects, transferring its properties, and creating the prototype chain. This object-based inheritance provides the flexibility and efficiency that web developers favor, yet this behavior opens applications to vulnerabilities via object manipulation.\nJavaScript objects are easily manipulated via static methods as demonstrated in this blog post. So, when is a case of object manipulation considered to be prototype pollution?\nConsider the following example of a constructor named Shape:\n \n\nA new object instance of the Shape object is created using the keyword new. \n\nThe inheritance schema can be illustrated as such:\n \n\nThe following shows the prototype chain where the __proto__ property of the objects are…",

However, organizations should properly assess security risks CDEs can introduce and are unique to their architectures, especially since they haven't received much scrutiny from the security community.\"Many questions remain unanswered with the adoption of cloud-based development environments: What happens if a cloud IDE workspace is infected with malware?

		"content": "Data security, user privacy, and information integrity are vital properties of today’s internet protocols and applications. The application of the internet in commercial activities such as online shopping, banking transactions, and eCommerce has significantly increased the value of critical data. Consequentially, networking protocols and applications have been developed for the purposes of safeguarding essential data through encryption, entity authenticity, and, most importantly, data integrity. However, application developers and protocol designers have always found it difficult to attain these objectives, so they rely on more established security protocols such as TLS and SSL protocol suites. The reason is that these protocols are built on thoroughgoing and excellently-analyzed cryptographic algorithms. Public key infrastructure (PKI) made with the X.509 standard is responsible for authentication. This article provides fine details about X.509 certificates and discusses why they are more condescending than conventional authentication. The X.509 Digital Certificate, What is it? The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standards define the format of public key infrastructure certificates. The X.509 certificate is one of the digital certificates based on ITU standards. The certificate employs the PKI infrastructure to verify that a particular public key belongs to a given computer, service, or user. The certificate was first introduced in 1988 alongside the X.500 standards that are widely applicable in electronic delivery services. Since then, the certificate has been widely adapted for use on web-based protocols. So, in one sentence, what is an X.509 certificate? An X.509 certificate refers to a special kind of digital certificate that employs international X.509 … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/what-is-x-509-certificate\">Continue reading \"What is an X.509 Certificate and How Does It Work?\"</a>",

Sign up here</a></strong>APIs may not seem like the sexiest thing to write about in a tech newsletter, but bear with me. Because APIs – or application programming interfaces – are important. They’re the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldn’t work.For example, when you visit a website that requires you to log in, and you choose to connect with a Google or Facebook account, you’re utilising an API. That click of a button that links your existing account on one platform with a new account on another is enabled by an API. They spring into action whenever one type of work interacts with another, working to bridge that gap. APIs are the overlooked and under-praised army that keeps the internet as we know it going. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/07/techscape-elon-musk-twitter-api\">Continue reading...</a>",

It doesn't even say what or where the problem might be, remaining stubbornly stuck at \"Checking server. Please wait ...\"<br />Ping and tracert indicate the server is still sitting pretty on its Internet perch, so my guess is something bizarre going on with the webserver, possibly an attack in progress but more likely a simple config problem somewhere along the long, long chain of links and systems between us and the server, maybe even the DNS.This is embarrssing given my professional interests, a bad start to the week but our incident management team is on the case, tooling-up as I speak.<br />So what can I say? Normal service will be resumed at some point, as soon as the office thaws and we have consumed a sufficiency of coffee to figure out what's going on and either fix it or get it fixed, that is. Meanwhile, I apologise for the inconvenience, and I'm grateful for the ability to send you this message through Blogger, a Google service that - for now at least - is still working.

The idea is, given the growing complexity of modern security threat landscapes, to let end user companies simply offload key parts of their security setups. That’s particularly important in the case of mid-size companies where the in-house security team might not be particularly large.Gartner’s 2021 Market Guide for XDR describes the technology as a way to integrate a wide array of different security tools — covering endpoints, network, email and so on — into a holistic picture. Rather than using a traditional <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2124604/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html\">SIEM</a> system, which is essentially just a log of all security related events, companies can use XDR to not only track events, but to quickly correlate them and separate false alarms from actual threats.<a href=\"/article/3690280/trustwave-teams-up-with-trellix-for-better-managed-security.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

		"content": "In October of 2022, a critical flaw was found in the SnakeYAML package, which allowed an attacker to benefit from remote code execution by sending malicious YAML content and this content being deserialized by the constructor. Finally, in February 2023, the SnakeYAML 2.0 release was pushed that resolves this flaw, also referred to as CVE-2022-1471. Let’s break down how this version can help you resolve this critical flaw. \nExploring Deserialization \nSnakeYAML is a popular Java library to parse YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language format). The library can parse all YAML 1.1 specifications [1], native types [2] and supports serializing and deserializing Java objects. The Remote Code Execution vulnerability is due to the library not restricting Java types when deserializing objects using `Constructor`.\nJava Serialization has the great promise of taking the state of a full object graph and saving it externally, then magically restoring its state when we deserialize. This is a big promise as…",

This put even more pressure on manufacturing organizations that were already feeling the heat. \nRecognizing that ransomware attacks can stem back to software vulnerabilities, many manufacturers are exploring ways to strengthen their software security programs. Our recent State of Software Security report v12 (SOSS), which analyzed 20 million scans across half a million applications, identified several manufacturing-specific trends that may help focus these efforts.  \nFirst up, some good news: The manufacturing industry now boasts the lowest number of software security flaws across all sectors, dethroning financial services from last year’s top spot. However, the manufacturing sector is also tied for the lowest number of flaws that are fixed. This means that manufacturing companies have security flaws in…",

PingOne Neo is designed as a decentralized platform, as opposed to the heavily federated systems commonly in use. It allows for data decentralization, storing credentials and keys on the user’s mobile device, and lets credentials be issued using a wider range of identity proofs, instead of particular government-issued ID.It works something like a wallet, according to the company. End users request a credential from an issuing organization, which is cryptographically signed and verifiable. That credential becomes a part of the user’s “digital wallet,” and works like a ticket into whatever system or application it is designed to access. PingOne Neo also supports other identity standards that are popular in the market, including OpenID, ISO and W3C.<a href=\"/article/3691232/ping-identity-debuts-decentralized-access-management-system-in-early-access.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

In our announcement blog, we noted new application development trends (like increased use of microservices and open-source libraries), the positive impact that Veracode Security Labs has on time to remediate security flaws, and the increased use of multiple application security scan types. But what we have yet to dive into is the security flaws we found in different programming languages.\nMuch like last year, we created an interactive heat map that lists out the most prevalent flaws by language along with an explanation of the flaw, supporting SOSS data, and tips for preventing the flaw.\n​\nIt’s interesting to see that what might be a common flaw for one language, might not even be of concern for another. Take cross-site scripting (XSS), for example. It’s the most common flaw for PHP – at 77.2 percent – but it doesn’t make the top 10 for C++.\nFor those of you familiar with last year’s heat map, you’…",

This includes the knowledge that there are only two possible outcomes: get hacked or don’t. “The psychological impact of this is profound, directly affecting decision quality and performance of cybersecurity leaders and their teams,” found Gartner.Although burnout is nothing new, it did become more visible and common during and after COVID-19. For CISOs it is worse as more than 50% are challenged with work demands that lead to a poor work-life balance at least once a month.

Brown’s in his Home Page, nor I, have an idea who wrote the following piece, but it is a brilliant satire of Stroustrup’s actual interview:1st of January, 1998 — Bjarne Stroustrup interview in IEEE’s ‘Computer’ magazineNaturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective<br />view of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language<br />he created.By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had<br />bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its<br />contents, ‘for the good of the industry’ but, as with many of these<br />things, there was a leak.Here is a complete transcript of what was was said, unedited, and<br />unrehearsed, so it isn’t as neat as planned interviews.You will find it interesting…__________________________________________________________________Interviewer: Well, it’s been a few years since you changed the<br /> world of software design, how does it feel, looking back?Stroustrup: Actually, I was thinking about those days, just before<br /> you arrived. Do you remember? Everyone was writing ‘C’<br /> and, the trouble was, they were pretty damn good at it.<br /> Universities got pretty good at teaching it, too. They were<br /> turning out competent — I stress the word ‘competent’ -<br /> graduates at a phenomenal rate. That’s what caused the<br /> problem.Interviewer: Problem?Stroustrup: Yes, problem. Remember when everyone wrote Cobol?Interviewer: Of course, I did tooStroustrup: Well, in the beginning, these guys were like demi-gods.<br /> Their salaries were high, and they were treated like royalty.Interviewer: Those were the days, eh?Stroustrup: Right. So what happened? IBM got sick of it, and<br /> invested millions in training programmers, till they were a<br /> dime a dozen.Interviewer: That’s why I got out. Salaries dropped within a year,<br /> to the point where being a journalist actually paid better.Stroustrup: Exactly. Well, the same happened with ‘C’ programmers.Interviewer: I see, but what’s the point?Stroustrup: Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I<br /> thought of this little scheme, which would redress the<br /> balance a little. I thought ‘I wonder what would happen, if<br /> there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn,<br /> that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with<br /> programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10,<br /> you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics<br /> system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things.<br /> They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really<br /> ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and<br /> pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows<br /> code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain<br /> your sanity.Interviewer: You’re kidding…?Stroustrup: Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another problem.<br /> Unix was written in ‘C’, which meant that any ‘C’ programmer<br /> could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember<br /> what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?Interviewer: You bet I do, that’s what I used to do.Stroustrup: OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from<br /> Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two<br /> together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew<br /> about DOS to earn a decent living too.Interviewer: I don’t believe you said that…Stroustrup: Well, it’s been long enough, now, and I believe most<br /> people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste<br /> of time but, I must say, it’s taken them a lot longer than I<br /> thought it would.Interviewer: So how exactly did you do it?Stroustrup: It was only supposed to be a joke, I never thought<br /> people would take the book seriously. Anyone with half a<br /> brain can see that object-oriented programming is<br /> counter-intuitive, illogical and inefficient.Interviewer: What?Stroustrup: And as for ‘re-useable code’ — when did you ever hear<br /> of a company re-using its code?Interviewer: Well, never, actually, but…Stroustrup: There you are then. Mind you, a few tried, in the<br /> early days. There was this Oregon company — Mentor<br /> Graphics, I think they were called — really caught a cold<br /> trying to rewrite everything in C++ in about ’90 or ’91. I<br /> felt sorry for them really, but I thought people would learn<br /> from their mistakes.Interviewer: Obviously, they didn’t?Stroustrup: Not in the slightest. Trouble is, most companies<br /> hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining a $30<br /> million loss to the shareholders would have been difficult.<br /> Give them their due, though, they made it work in the end.Interviewer: They did? Well, there you are then, it proves O-O works.Stroustrup: Well, almost. The executable was so huge, it took<br /> five minutes to load, on an HP workstation, with 128MB of<br /> RAM. Then it ran like treacle. Actually, I thought this<br /> would be a major stumbling-block, and I’d get found out<br /> within a week, but nobody cared. Sun and HP were only too<br /> glad to sell enormously powerful boxes, with huge resources<br /> just to run trivial programs. You know, when we had our<br /> first C++ compiler, at AT&amp;T, I compiled ‘Hello World’, and<br /> couldn’t believe the size of the executable. 2.1MBInterviewer: What? Well, compilers have come a long way, since then.Stroustrup: They have? Try it on the latest version of g++ — you<br /> won’t get much change out of half a megabyte. Also, there<br /> are several quite recent examples for you, from all over the<br /> world. British Telecom had a major disaster on their hands<br /> but, luckily, managed to scrap the whole thing and start<br /> again. They were luckier than Australian Telecom. Now I<br /> hear that Siemens is building a dinosaur, and getting more<br /> and more worried as the size of the hardware gets bigger, to<br /> accommodate the executables. Isn’t multiple inheritance a joy?Interviewer: Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language.Stroustrup: You really believe that, don’t you? Have you ever sat<br /> down and worked on a C++ project? Here’s what happens:<br /> First, I’ve put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only<br /> the most trivial projects will work first time. Take<br /> operator overloading. At the end of the project, almost<br /> every module has it, usually, because guys feel they really<br /> should do it, as it was in their training course. The same<br /> operator then means something totally different in every<br /> module. Try pulling that lot together, when you have a<br /> hundred or so modules. And as for data hiding. God, I<br /> sometimes can’t help laughing when I hear about the problems<br /> companies have making their modules talk to each other. I<br /> think the word ‘synergistic’ was specially invented to twist<br /> the knife in a project manager’s ribs.Interviewer: I have to say, I’m beginning to be quite appalled at<br /> all this. You say you did it to raise programmers’<br /> salaries? That’s obscene.Stroustrup: Not really. Everyone has a choice. I didn’t expect<br /> the thing to get so much out of hand. Anyway, I basically<br /> succeeded. C++ is dying off now, but programmers still get<br /> high salaries — especially those poor devils who have to<br /> maintain all this crap. You do realise, it’s impossible to<br /> maintain a large C++ software module if you didn’t actually<br /> write it?Interviewer: How come?Stroustrup: You are out of touch, aren’t you? Remember the typedef?Interviewer: Yes, of course.Stroustrup: Remember how long it took to grope through the header<br /> files only to find that ‘RoofRaised’ was a double precision<br /> number? Well, imagine how long it takes to find all the<br /> implicit typedefs in all the Classes in a major project.Interviewer: So how do you reckon you’ve succeeded?Stroustrup: Remember the length of the average-sized ‘C’ project?<br /> About 6 months. Not nearly long enough for a guy with a<br /> wife and kids to earn enough to have a decent standard of<br /> living. Take the same project, design it in C++ and what do<br /> you get? I’ll tell you. One to two years. Isn’t that<br /> great? All that job security, just through one mistake of<br /> judgement. And another thing. The universities haven’t<br /> been teaching ‘C’ for such a long time, there’s now a<br /> shortage of decent ‘C’ programmers. Especially those who<br /> know anything about Unix systems programming. How many guys<br /> would know what to do with ‘malloc’, when they’ve used ‘new’<br /> all these years — and never bothered to check the return<br /> code. In fact, most C++ programmers throw away their return<br /> codes. Whatever happened to good ol’ ‘-1’? At least you<br /> knew you had an error, without bogging the thing down in all<br /> that ‘throw’ ‘catch’ ‘try’ stuff.Interviewer: But, surely, inheritance does save a lot of time?Stroustrup: Does it? Have you ever noticed the difference between<br /> a ‘C’ project plan, and a C++ project plan? The planning<br /> stage for a C++ project is three times as long. Precisely<br /> to make sure that everything which should be inherited is,<br /> and what shouldn’t isn’t. Then, they still get it wrong.<br /> Whoever heard of memory leaks in a ‘C’ program? Now finding<br /> them is a major industry. Most companies give up, and send<br /> the product out, knowing it leaks like a sieve, simply to<br /> avoid the expense of tracking them all down.Interviewer: There are tools…Stroustrup: Most of which were written in C++.Interviewer: If we publish this, you’ll probably get lynched, you<br /> do realise that?Stroustrup: I doubt it. As I said, C++ is way past its peak now,<br /> and no company in its right mind would start a C++ project<br /> without a pilot trial. That should convince them that it’s<br /> the road to disaster. If not, they deserve all they get. You<br /> know, I tried to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix in C++.Interviewer: Oh my God. What did he say?Stroustrup: Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor. I think<br /> both he and Brian figured out what I was doing, in the early<br /> days, but never let on. He said he’d help me write a C++<br /> version of DOS, if I was interested.Interviewer: Were you?Stroustrup: Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I’ll give you a demo<br /> when we’re through. I have it running on a Sparc 20 in the<br /> computer room. Goes like a rocket on 4 CPU’s, and only<br /> takes up 70 megs of disk.Interviewer: What’s it like on a PC?Stroustrup: Now you’re kidding. Haven’t you ever seen Windows ‘95?<br /> I think of that as my biggest success. Nearly blew the game<br /> before I was ready, though.Interviewer: You know, that idea of a Unix++ has really got me<br /> thinking. Somewhere out there, there’s a guy going to try it.Stroustrup: Not after they read this interview.Interviewer: I’m sorry, but I don’t see us being able to publish<br /> any of this.Stroustrup: But it’s the story of the century. I only want to be<br /> remembered by my fellow programmers, for what I’ve done for<br /> them. You know how much a C++ guy can get these days?Interviewer: Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 — $80 an<br /> hour.Stroustrup: See? And I bet he earns it. Keeping track of all the<br /> gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job. And, as I said<br /> before, every C++ programmer feels bound by some mystic<br /> promise to use every damn element of the language on every<br /> project. Actually, that really annoys me sometimes, even<br /> though it serves my original purpose. I almost like the<br /> language after all this time.Interviewer: You mean you didn’t before?Stroustrup: Hated it. It even looks clumsy, don’t you agree? But<br /> when the book royalties started to come in… well, you get<br /> the picture.Interviewer: Just a minute. What about references? You must<br /> admit, you improved on ‘C’ pointers.Stroustrup: Hmm. I’ve always wondered about that. Originally, I<br /> thought I had. Then, one day I was discussing this with a<br /> guy who’d written C++ from the beginning. He said he could<br /> never remember whether his variables were referenced or<br /> dereferenced, so he always used pointers. He said the<br /> little asterisk always reminded him.Interviewer: Well, at this point, I usually say ‘thank you very<br /> much’ but it hardly seems adequate.Stroustrup: Promise me you’ll publish this. My conscience is<br /> getting the better of me these days.Interviewer: I’ll let you know, but I think I know what my editor<br /> will say.Stroustrup: Who’d believe it anyway? Although, can you send me a<br /> copy of that tape?Interviewer: I can do that.<a href=\"https://medium.com/assorted-thoughts/c-is-it-really-a-cruel-joke-af43176361e1\">C++: Is It Really a Cruel Joke?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/assorted-thoughts\">Assorted Thoughts</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

		"content": "\n\t\nDeploying security patches as quickly as possible remains one of the best ways to prevent most security breaches, as attackers usually rely on exploits for publicly known vulnerabilities that have a patch available -- the so-called n-day exploits. But mitigating the risk from vulnerabilities unknown to the affected software developers and don't have a patch available -- the zero-day flaws -- requires a careful analysis of the types of actors exploiting them, the geography and industries they target, the malware payloads they deploy, the tactics they use, and the type of products they usually target.According to <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-days-exploited-2022\">an analysis</a> by Google-owned threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant, attackers exploited 55 zero-day flaws last year, fewer than the 81 observed in 2021 but triple the number tracked in 2020 and higher than in any previous years. In fact, 2020 was an outlier because security vendors saw their normal workflows disrupted by the COVID pandemic that year, possibly impacting their ability to discover and track zero-day attacks.<a href=\"/article/3691609/55-zero-day-flaws-exploited-last-year-show-the-importance-of-security-risk-management.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

This means they grew up experiencing a much faster rate in which technology evolves. The first iPhone, for example, was launched in January 2007 with its successor coming out in June 2008, creating what would become an almost yearly update that made thousands of people line up in front of Apple stores across the world on release day.

Accordingly, CISOs will need to direct their teams to conduct red team exercises against AI models and AI-enabled applications — just as security teams do with any traditional application, platform, or IT system.AI increasingly powers business decision-making, financial forecasting, predictive maintenance, and an endless list of other enterprise functions, weaving its way inextricably into the enterprise tech stack.This is where AI red teaming comes into play. Forward-looking security pundits believe that the field of AI risk management and AI assurance will be a growing domain for CISOs and cybersecurity leaders to get a handle on in the coming years.

One issue that has caught the attention of many in the security field is whether the technology’s ingestion of sensitive business data puts organizations at risk. There is some fear that if one inputs sensitive information — quarterly reports, materials for an internal presentation, sales numbers, or the like — and asks ChatGPT to write text around it, that anyone could gain information on that company simply by asking ChatGPT about it later.The implications of that could be far-reaching: Imagine working on an internal presentation that contained new corporate data revealing a corporate problem to be discussed at a board meeting. Letting that proprietary information out into the wild could undermine stock price, consumer attitudes, and client confidence. Even worse, a legal item on the agenda being leaked could expose a company to real liability.

Several sophisticated cyber-attacks often start with phishing emails sent to unsuspecting employees. This results in a compromise of confidential information and/or privileged credentials. And this consequently leads to entire business networks being compromised and sensitive information being leaked.  \nBusiness travellers, in particular, are always at risk of becoming victims of cybercrime. This is simply because they regularly venture out of the safe cocoon of their office premises and the well-regulated IT infrastructure. ",

		"content": "CM.4 Conversion without exponentialsPart of a series on <a href=\"https://medium.com/cloud-security/cybersecurity-math-34485d45c7d0\">Cybersecurity Math</a>.Please read the following posts first unless you are already familiar with these concepts:Why binary and hexadecimal are used with computers.Why that matters for cybersecurity.The relationship between binary, decimal, and hexadecimalHow to count in binary<a href=\"https://medium.com/cloud-security/numbering-systems-base-2-base-10-etc-49845c7a3f87\">Numbering systems (base 2, base 10, base 16)</a>How to count in hexadecimal<a href=\"https://medium.com/cloud-security/counting-in-hexadecimal-base-16-bd02cf6a88fb\">Counting in Hexadecimal (Base 16)</a>In this post I’ll explain how to convert larger binary numbers to decimal and hexadecimal using a trick I learned off a video. Unfortunately, I didn’t save the link. At the time I first learned this concept I only found one video that showed this method. Now there are others. It was a kind of hyper speaker very excited and talking about how calculators are bad and not allowed on tests from sometime around 2012 or 2013 or maybe even prior to that. If you see a speaker calmly explaining this concept in a video — that’s not the one. :-)And, as always, I’m adding my own little twist to it with a few graphics. What we will not be using, are exponentials. I find this method to be simpler for my brain to deal with for whatever reason.<strong>Converting binary to decimal</strong>First, we need to assign each digit in our binary number a value.Let’s say we had 5 digits in our binary number.Start with one.Double the number and add the result to the left.Repeat the last step until you have the required number of values.Now let’s say we want to convert the binary <strong>1010</strong> to decimal.Repeat the concept above for each digit.The zero’s are “off” as explained in a prior post. The one’s are “on”.Add up the value of the numbers that are “on.”That’s it. Now you can convert any binary number to decimal.Let’s try a bigger number.You can do this with any length of binary digits. I’ll show you an even longer caclulation below.<strong>Convert a binary number to hexadecimal</strong>Now let’s say we want to convert the above binary number to hexadecimal.Here’s the important point:<strong><em>Each four binary digits in a binary number represents one hexadecimal digit.</em></strong>As I explained before the size of each binary digit is one bit, so the size of a hexadecimal number is 4 bits.Recall our earlier chart that I recommended you might want to memorize:Now lets translate this hexadecimal value to binary: <strong>AE06</strong>If you have memorized this chart as I recommended it would be easy to write out the four digits for each hexadecimal number like this:Note that I dropped the leading 0’s in the middle column above. Pad each binary number with zeros so it becomes a 4 bit number. In other words, 0 = 0000 and 110 = 0110.To come up with a binary number, I simply replaced each digit in AE06 with the corresponding binary digits in the image above.If you haven’t memorized the numbers above and you don’t have a chart handy, you can look them up in a chart or calculate them using the methods I showed in the prior two posts.Now let’s say you want to know the decimal value of <strong>AE06</strong>.Now that we know the binary number, you can use the method I showed you at the top of the post to calculate the decimal value. Figure out the value of each position of your binary number. Add up the values where the digit is “on” or 1.You can check your work using an online conversion site like the one included in my prior posts, or a calculator that will do the conversion for you. On a Mac check your work by typing the number into the calculator:Then choose programmer from the view menu.Woot! Our value matches.This method might get cumbersome for very large numbers but I presume at that point you likely have a calculator available to you or some type of programming language to speed up the process. But it works nicely for most smaller hexadecimal values such as those commonly found in network packet headers, for example. It also works if you need to validate that a program is properly converting values from hexadecimal to binary to decimal.Follow for updates.Teri Radichel | <em>© </em><a href=\"https://2ndsightlab.com/?source=post_page---------------------------\"><em>2nd Sight Lab</em></a><em> 2023</em><strong>Like this story?

Sometimes, even just the perception of the industry as “male dominated” can discourage women from participating. In this edition of our blog, Jane explains that women can push back against unconscious bias by continuing to bring our “A” game, expose unfair stereotyping, and challenge the ‘expected and accepted’ to prompt change. She believes that encouraging more woman into the industry will change its perception and inspire younger generations to choose a career in technology.",

While stakeholders agreed that this was a valuable tool for improving security, recent feedback indicates that there may be a better way to achieve this goal.<br />",

		"content": "Code signing certificates and SSL certificates are digital security certificates that are used to establish trust and authenticity in digital communications. However, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. But before we move to their differences, let’s check out what both these certificates offer in terms of security. What is an SSL Certificate? SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificates are cryptographic protocols that use encryption security for securing digital data. They secure all the browser-server exchanges with encryption, thus providing a secured link between two network devices. This digital certificate safeguards the website/customer data against hackers since it encrypts data by converting the plain text into a cipher text which looks gibberish. Nowadays, this secured HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) protocol is majorly used in all e-mail communications, instant messaging, digital transactions, etc. thus securing all communications over unsecured HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) networks. How does SSL Certificate Work? When a user visits a website, the user’s browser and the web server communicate with each other. An SSL handshake process commences ensuring that there is secured and encrypted communication between these two parties. The initial process commences with the browser trying to communicate with the server who has an SSL certificate installed on it. The browser will request the server to identify itself. In reply, the server will submit its SSL certificate to the browser along with the public key. The browser will verify the SSL certificate by confirming the expiry status, revocation status, and other … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/code-signing-certificate-vs-ssl-certificate\">Continue reading \"Difference between Code Signing Certificate and SSL Certificate\"</a>",

In the past few years, the usage of Spyware has increased, which serves as a constant threat to your data. This piece is specifically designed to highlight diverse types of Spyware and how to protect yourself and your data from it.  What is Spyware? Spyware is a piece of malicious software used by hackers to access and steal personal data from a victim’s device. It operates by infecting your device and affecting its functionality. What makes Spyware lethal is that it is very difficult to identify as it is usually masked and can sit in your device unnoticed, however in extreme cases, it may cause noticeable lag, and in some cases, it may charge your credit card with small amounts, hence if this happens, you must immediately seek help as your device is potentially infected by a Spyware. Types of Spyware Like computer viruses, Spyware can also be classified into diverse types. Here is a list of the most widely known types of Spyware.  Infostealers It is the type of Spyware that specifically targets user data such as passwords, personal and financial details, and documents. It sits on your device unidentified and passes the sensitive information to the hacker. The information could thereafter be sold or used by the hacker for their benefit. Infostealers are often Trojan viruses, which means that once activated, they would start gathering sensitive personal information from different files and … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/what-is-spyware\">Continue reading \"What is Spyware?

		"content": "A secure socket layer (SSL) certificate, Currently Transport Security Layer (TLS) certificate, is a small cryptographic technology applied in encrypting data and communications between web servers and web browsers. But I am sure you already know what an SSL Certificate is. When people talk of TLS certificates, they often refer to server certificates. As the name implies, server certificates are essential in authenticating servers to clients. Typically, this is the standard way of authentication. But have you ever wondered how it would be when you wanted to authenticate the client to the browser? This is where 2 Way SSL (or two-way SSL if you like) comes into sight. Wondering what that is and how it works? Wonder no more! In our endless quest to simplify all complex tech-related topics, we will break down everything for you by telling you what a two-way SSL certificate is and how it works. To better understand a two-way TLS certificate, it would be best to start by looking at the working of SSL authentication. A Brief Overview of How TLS Certificate Authentication Works First, the owner of a website purchases an SSL certificate for their website domain/s. The website owner then sends an unsigned certificate together with the associated public keys to the certificate authority. The certificate authority is mandated to ascertain the validity of the person requesting the certificate and confirm domain ownership. The technical process for this is the Validation process. Suppose the certificate authority validates domain ownership and the requestor’s authenticity … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/what-is-2-way-ssl-and-how-does-it-work\">Continue reading \"2 WAY SSL Certificate: Brief Overview of How it Works?\"</a>",

		"content": "Web developers use code signing certificates for digitally signing applications, scripts, executables, drivers, software, etc. These digitally signed applications/software ensure the end users that the app codes they have downloaded are not compromised or altered, i.e., the codes are authentic and secured. All popular OS like MS Windows, Apple, etc. displays a warning message to end users in case they download software that is not secured with digital signatures. Code Signing certificates are of two types: the OV Code Signing certificate and the EV Code Signing certificate. This blog will discuss the EV Code Signing Certificate, its features, and its functioning. What are EV Code Signing Certificates? EV Code Signing Certificates Enhance User Trust and Confidence. EV (Extended Validation) code signing certificates are digital X.509 certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), just like SSL certificates. But the only difference between SSL certificates and EV code signing certificates is that SSL certificates secure the web and data. In contrast, EV code signing certificates secure the software, driver, and app code. EV code signing certificates are an excellent amalgamation of varied security benefits. This includes the benefits of digital signatures on codes, a thorough vetting process for strong security, fulfilling all code security needs, etc. These certificates help verify the publisher’s authenticity when they sign their software/app since their name and the company name are visible on the software. This helps enhance user trust and confidence since they portray application/software integrity and authenticity. They also help bypass Microsoft SmartScreen warning alerts, … <a href=\"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/how-does-ev-code-signing-certificate-works\">Continue reading \"How Does EV Code Signing Certificate Works?\"</a>",

We had the binary, but unfortunately, as we discovered, it was encrypted - this became a serious challenge for us, and that is when we broke out the hardware attacks. Senior Security Engineer Maxwell Dulin has published an outstanding write-up for his approach to this. I recommend that you check it out for an insight into our process.",

I'd like to thank Blogger and Google for providing this platform for two decades. It's tough to find extant self-hosted security content that was born at the same time, or earlier. Bruce Schneier's <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/\">Schneier on Security</a> is the main one that comes to mind. If not for the wonderful <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>, many blogs from the early days would be lost.StatisticsIn my <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/01/happy-15th-birthday-taosecurity-blog.html\">15 year post</a> I included some statistics, so here are a few, current as of the evening of 7 January:<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCxcThtGMupoQEucIYaF1m2YRVp9vtCObwzOondALVDmUBhwWIGhLiBeEe_hK_BxbCtNKcA95cSMg3NoT4k79k3rco0BYVugwM9dMOoKLX7eSDqTMVMjTHegX0d0kkg6raamB_akd0qCeCKiJcYQH1XsqQt-V1kpoI2un2ymp_kLV0KCrDpw/s2533/capture_001_07012023_201618.jpg\"></a>I think it's cool to see almost 29 million \"all time\" views, but that's not the whole story.Here are the so-called \"all time\" statistics:<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCL5xPkqzGWyUhIwSKeDQ-O7C-i8wsJH7gOqMxBb5uYeeZfqd3bYoa9rbyWS1G7sOukQc0IHBJl8hC2X-IP__eTvYPIzqtXeWbev_juU1x6jfuCovFFBDhAqupBE-Mefo37hV4jHOF1B_1YEa4DlEoe-XulSyqCH-a5es7olM3olWgk4ZBBg/s2440/capture_002_07012023_201801.jpg\"></a><br />It turns out that Blogger only started capturing these numbers in January 2011. That means I've had almost 29 million views in the last 12 years. I don't know what happened on 20 April 2022, when I had almost 1.5 million views?Top Ten Posts Since January 2011Here are the top ten all time posts:<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSBwNraUq0w3DZ5r8O3gIpo1MOE84ZCpA8WxtJb4mt_KNcXy0oSmMRfC8aV_L4U6UbG0LWqURCMdYAgBAdragJNlmy40J7wQ13kLxSGLxggD0WV4GLqNTWQQ5uA74PJXNFOnZnZvW7vngJeSOgBejtJZ4m5cvixqWx7so98V3bCsHjSIFu6Q/s2426/capture_003_07012023_202102.jpg\"></a>I'm really pleased to see posts like <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2020/10/security-and-one-percent-thought.html\">Security and the One Percent: A Thought Exercise in Estimation and Consequences</a> and <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2021/02/digital-offense-capabilities-are.html\">Digital Offense Capabilities Are Currently Net Negative for the Security Ecosystem</a> in this list. We've had some discussion on these topics since I posted them in the fall of 2020, but not enough. The 99% continue to suffer at the hands of adversaries and those in the security 1% who ignore them.The Monetization ExperimentI ran an advertising experiment from April 2021 through December 2022. I \"earned\" $116.96 by February 2022 and $104.39 by December 2022. I don't have view numbers for that whole period, but for calendar year 2022 I attracted a little over 7.5 million views. You can see that I earned about 1.4 x 10^-5 dollars per view. I disabled ads at the end of December.From Twitter to MastodonOne big change I can discern since my 15 year post is that I have now abandoned Twitter and migrated to Mastodon. You can find me at <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@taosecurity\">infosec.exchange/@taosecurity</a>. My current Twitter follower count is about 59.7k, down from just over 60k. My current Mastodon follower count is 1.9k. I don't really care about followers, but I figured I would capture these numbers to see if there is any change in the next five years.The Latest BooksI spent the early years of the pandemic collecting my 3,000 or so favorite blog posts into a four volume set called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XdChgJ\">The Best of TaoSecurity Blog</a>. I'm really pleased with these books, available via Amazon in print or digital format. They include original posts, but each receives commentary with modern thoughts on the original content. The fourth volume includes material not found in the blog, such as unpublished writings from my abandoned War Studies PhD program or Congressional testimonies.<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDt2cOrQOJLBDsVfwR0fXlVDFRWihYt8JhzZ11JoNPYGkJ9pzS06WK-RKrLGstmUkDvmbxpxeQv2nhknN2n36jqvXjVUzzcvVTuvByn7voFlN8txab5fx3xmSmDLaNx8VsWLh1xoQUG5P60lN9KuG1ZtYkVu633_pkrqeJ4XkXEqO2QZTlBg/s1600/four%20books.jpg\"></a>It looks like Amazon is randomly running a promotion on volume 2 of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CUhur5\">The Best of TaoSecurity Blog</a> while I am writing this post. The print edition is regularly $19.95, but it's currently priced at $7.89. I don't know how long it will last, but if you're interested please check it out. I also co-wrote and published a book on stretching with a subject matter expert -- <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Gn1u1r\">Reach Your Goal: Stretching &amp; Mobility Exercises for Fitness, Personal Training, &amp; Martial Arts</a>. <a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPuJrH7q06L9Cm_HLS5HgG3MZmDXiPTAmg31epFT4Ac486MMhnwSli__rUTlg9l7ZxJaS4sc4lIqSmbFn4Fpkj__Rb3OofL4Lm0V237wLxJppYBB8wy4zp4v9gJN7rG8HzZNrCh8dYqVJgt7kjBuZAwTTzrychQ-h2kbTqRo1rP605t3JKWw/s1360/61IAqWsOtKL.jpg\"></a><br />Thanks to ARB for taking the excellent photos!Enter CorelightI have been <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/09/twenty-years-of-network-security.html\">working at Corelight since August 2018</a>. Our <a href=\"https://corelight.com/\">Corelight</a> network security monitoring platform is really amazing and I suggest everyone check it out. We continue to have big plans for the future. Zeek CommunicatorSince 2018 I have assumed the communications role for the <a href=\"https://zeek.org/\">Zeek network security monitoring project</a>. Besides posting announcements to <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@zeek\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/80104000/\">LinkedIn</a>, I also share interaction and admin duties for our <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/zeekorg/shared_invite/zt-1ev1nr7z4-rEVSsaIzYzFWpdgh2I6ZOg\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://community.zeek.org/\">Discourse</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/Zeekurity\">YouTube</a> sites. I'm working with the leadership team on strategies for growing community size and involvement in 2023 and beyond.HobbiesDuring the last five years, I earned a <a href=\"https://martialvitality.blogspot.com/2018/12/thoughts-on-my-krav-maga-global-g1-test.html\">black belt equivalent in Krav Maga Global</a> (the system uses patches, not belts) and a <a href=\"https://martialvitality.blogspot.com/2019/10/passing-my-bjj-blue-belt-test.html\">blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> (helping me to survive grappling with Jeremiah Grossman at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdqEcn0lwM\">2019 BJJ Smackdown during Black Hat</a>). I've <a href=\"https://martialvitality.blogspot.com/2022/12/retiring-from-martial-arts-for-now-at.html\">retired from practicing martial arts</a>, for now at least. However, my <a href=\"https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/\">Martial History Team</a> project continues, with plans through June 2025.<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiL_CQ2D18Pu81BqXX_O4kQJqYcvUv_0OuCNoJ7-iCwvdSMvKsgKywDPybxaMBiE9FB-ACi7faQIAS7CpQOtQCMgUtkK25BER3vlW_9ZdQOQli9GiRmCk7BuhyLl1cL6GTDpIMrAeoFjvbswPiMuBn4zd9Pli6Jrqa6CXMjtvD1_V5o7-0JqA/s446/martial%20history%20team%20logo%20be%20devoted.jpg\"></a><br />I read a ton of books every month, but almost none have to do with technical security topics. My interests include US Civil War history, general military and nation state strategy, unidentified aerial phenomena, airpower, science, intelligence, and other topics. I have a strict monthly schedule and thus far have been able to stick to it for the last 16 months. I don't write reviews anymore, but I do write <a href=\"https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/search/label/survey\">surveys</a> for the martial arts books -- 36 so far.Finally, in 2022 I returned to one of my childhood hobbies, first begin in the fall of 1982 -- tabletop roleplaying games. I've been informally studying science fiction RPGs since the beginning of last year, potentially to begin another PhD program. I think it would be interesting to research a history PhD involving science fiction RPGs. I don't say much publicly about this, although I do have a <a href=\"https://dice.camp/@scifittrpg\">Mastodon account for Science Fiction TTRPGs</a>. I've also been playing in an online <i>Star Frontiers</i> campaign with a group scattered throughout the US. <a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXyXDBTPDWUXTkeoqnHxXBn6TxodeSabn9KI3SNF6fTcNnRruUGt05XqCTd1tA1neSbtKvfMz-MKzRMGchY6wyJWLitrWpCH_9WSIL-D-qCLXlIXQpoOjaTVAiKMGjfvl-up9hYJNtacdJpbxTqWPYMV3T5HFPKMOjCt1fcATMXP5QTj2eFQ/s1044/star%20frontiers%20modified%20elmore%20cover.jpg\"></a><i>SF</i> was the first RPG I ever played, so it was cool to return to playing on its 40th birthday in August 2022.ConclusionAs you might discern, I'm expressing myself in many different venues. As a result, I don't feel the need or desire to post here, at least not that often. In 2003, most of the platforms mentioned in this post didn't exist. Blogs were the hot new communication medium. Prior to that, security people published \"white papers\" in text form to sites like <a href=\"https://packetstormsecurity.com/\">Packet Storm</a>! (Check out <a href=\"https://packetstormsecurity.com/search/?q=bejtlich\">two of my entries here</a>. Those are the PDF versions.)As far as security goes, I mostly care about the operational/campaign and higher levels of conflict, e.g.:<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieprFI_cz9vypMa-9fP-cGZCfI5RvrQ_DyCuK4VF9dxRNPZ6xAlY525fKZIeNL99QFO_FcDYIkAqWcCOikLWtzetsydSBHcEp4ZK4bKmBEGAEf86FF6fYHrWP69dw0GlIgGQn9znbQw3k1E_8eNohPnBoPR78l7QMOLt-jAN8DIT0tEhH6CA/s1885/strategy%20levels.jpg\"></a><br />In my opinion, the tactics used by intruders and defenders, and even most of the tools, have not really changed in the last 10 years, and definitely not since 2018. The operations/campaigns and strategies used by both sides haven't really changed either. There are a few exceptions, like <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor\">the massive SolarWinds supply chain compromise Mandiant discovered and published in December 2020</a>. Ransomware has definitely ramped up to gross levels since 2018. However, there haven't been any game-changers as far as how offense and defense interact. Sure, way more processing is done in the cloud, and just about everything is running a vulnerable computer. However, no one on the offensive or defensive sides has significantly innovated to alter the way the two parties interact. Until that changes, security for me is largely a less interesting, but still unsolved, wicked problem. Thank you to everyone who has been part of this blog's journey since 2003!Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I found this beauty in one of my boxes. It's a <a href=\"https://www.netgear.com/support/product/EN104TP.aspx\">Netgear EN104TP hub</a>. I've mentioned this device before, in this blog and my books. This sort of device was the last of the true hubs. In an age where cables seem reserved for data centers or industrial facilities, and wireless rules the home and office, this hub is a relic of days gone past.To give you a sense of how old this device is, the Netgear documentation (still online -- well done) offers a PDF created in August 1998. (Again, well done Netgear, not mucking about with the timestamps.) I'm not sure how old my specific device is. Seeing as I started working in the AFCERT in the fall of 1998, I could see this hub being easily over 20 years old. A hub is a network device that accepts traffic from its ports and repeats the traffic to all other ports. This is different from a switch, which maintains a table identifying which MAC addresses are in use on which ports. Before building this CAM (content addressable memory, IIRC) table, traffic to a new previously unforeseen MAC address will appear on all ports save the sender.This is a \"true hub\" because all of the ports are 10 Mbps. Yes, that is 100 times \"slower\" than the Gigabit ports on modern devices, if they have Ethernet ports at all. Starting with 10/100 Mbps devices, they all became switches. I never encountered a 100 Mbps \"hub.\" Every device I ever had hands on was a 10/100 Mbps switch. That meant you were unlikely to see traffic on all ports when using a 10/100 Mbps device or even a 100 Mbps device (which I never saw anyway). There were no Gigabit (1000 Mbps) hubs built. I don't think the specification even supports it.These little boxes were network monitoring enablers. If you wanted to learn, or troubleshoot, or possibly even add monitoring to a production network, you could connect an upstream cable, a downstream cable, and a monitoring cable to the hub. The upstream could be a router and the downstream might be a firewall, and the monitoring would be your NSM server. If you were looking at traffic between two individual computers and needed visibility for a NSM laptop, you would plug all three into the hub, and plug your Internet upstream into the fourth port.I haven't needed this device in years, but I plan to keep it as a physical artifact of a time long past. At least this one still powers on, unlike my first computer, a Timex Sinclair ZX-80.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

It features posts from other blogs or news outlets, as well as some of his written testimony from eleven Congressional hearings. For the first time, Mr. Bejtlich publishes documents that he wrote as part of his abandoned war studies PhD program. This last batch of content was only available to his advisor, Dr. Thomas Rid, and his review committee at King's College London.Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve national security have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.This will likely be my final collection of writings. I've discovered some documents that may be of interest to historians, so I may contribute those to a <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cyber-vault/2019-06-29/joint-task-force-computer-network-defense-20-years-later\">national security archive like my friend Jay Healey did a few years ago</a>.The only other work I might do for these four volumes is to record Audible editions. That would take a while, but I'm thinking about it.<br />Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Her discussion of the group formerly known as Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, reminded me of a controversy that arose in the 2000s. I had heard through back channels that some members of that group were upset that I was operating using the name TaoSecurity. In the 2000s and early 2010s I taught classes under the TaoSecurity brand, and even ran TaoSecurity as a single-person consultancy from 2005-2007. The purpose of this post is to explain why, how, and when I chose the TaoSecurity identity, and to show that it is contemporaneous with the formal naming of the TAO group. The most reliable accounts indicate TaoSecurity predates the TAO brand.TaoSecurity Began with Kung Fu and Taoism<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D8-UkVNTDBA/YGXefnEA0wI/AAAAAAABLAk/szvRpmdQ1s8MG66AMWDpk09GRk2HNzr1wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1095/martialarts-rich-sifu-21jun1996.jpg\"></a>With Sifu Michael Macaris, 21 June 1996<br />In the summer of 1994, after graduating from the Air Force Academy and before beginning my graduate program at what is now called the Harvard Kennedy School, I started watching re-runs of the <a href=\"https://sourcingbrucelee.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-truth-about-creation-of-kung-fu-tv.html\">1970s David Carradine Kung Fu TV series, created by Ed Spielman</a>. I was so motivated by the philosophical message of the program that I joined a kung fu school in Massachusetts. I trained there for two years, and studied what I could about Chinese history and culture. I learned from the show and that it was based on Taoism (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rkT0tR5WVF0?t=57\">for example</a>) so I bought a copy of the <a href=\"https://terebess.hu/english/tao/_index.html\">Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu</a> and devoured it. Visiting China<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vx04Tg43MXE/YGXg90FbmVI/AAAAAAABLAs/49hN4bzZVhUDARC2bu65D49TanTFmiXPgCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/tai%2Bchi.jpg\"></a>Tai Chi on the Yangtze, May 1999<br />In the spring of 1999 my wife and I took a three week trip to China for our honeymoon. We were both interested in Chinese culture so it seemed like a great opportunity. It was an amazing trip, despite the fact that we were in China when the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48134881\">United States bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade</a>. I include these details to show that I was quite the fan of Chinese culture, well before any formal cyber threat intelligence reports associated me with China. I read books on Taoism and embraced its concepts.Creating TaoSecurity<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QLrYJLmNI8M/YGXi6zH64ZI/AAAAAAABLA0/GHyetm1rEY4Z_nyn0Ed1-oyLFaYjHlQlACLcBGAsYHQ/s798/capture_001_01042021_111146.jpg\"></a>WHOIS lookup for taosecurity.com<br />In the summer of 2000 I was a captain at the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team, within the 33rd Information Operations Squadron. I decided I wanted to try creating a Web presence, so I registered the TaoSecurity domain name on 4 July 2000. The WHOIS record above shows 3 July, which is odd, because a <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2019/07/happy-birthday-taosecuritycom.html\">previous post on the topic captured the correct date of 4 July 2000</a>. I also coined the phrase \"the way of digital security.\"My wife commissioned an artist to design the TaoSecurity logo, which I have used continuously since then. At the time I had never heard of TAO. There was a good reason for that. TAO was just being born as well.General Hayden on Creating TAO<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y-lTCRyg_bU/YGXwVWyWkJI/AAAAAAABLBQ/VbAinamJqmsCT74hHk-qV-wdtohyWs6PgCPcBGAYYCw/s1499/cover.jpg\"></a><i>Playing to the Edge</i> by General Michael Hayden<br />The first public source on the history of TAO appeared in a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130616121605/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/10/inside_the_nsa_s_ultra_secret_china_hacking_group?page=full\">2013 story for Foreign Policy by Matthew M. Aid</a>. He claimed that the agency created TAO in 1997. While it is possible that members of what would later be named TAO were working a similar mission in 1997, his story requires details that I add next.A succinct source on the origins of the unit previously known as the TAO is the 18 October 2018 article by Steven Loleski. He wrote a piece called <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684527.2018.1532627\">From cold to cyber warriors: the origins and expansion of NSA’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) to Shadow Brokers</a> (<a href=\"https://canvas.tufts.edu/files/1299545/download?download_frd=1\">PDF</a>). Mr. Loleski cited General Michael Hayden's 2016 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rBtV2o\">Playing to the Edge</a>, which I quote more extensively here:\"<b>In the last days of 2000</b>, as we were rewiring the entire agency’s organizational chart (see chapter 2), we set up an enterprise called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, in the newly formed SIGINT Directorate (SID). We had toyed with some boutique end-point efforts before, but this was different. This was going to be industrial strength...And, even in a period of generalized growth, TAO became the fastest-growing part of NSA post-9/11, bar none.\"Seeing as General Hayden was in charge of NSA at the time, that would seem to make it clear that TaoSecurity preceded TAO by several months, at least.I also looked for details in the 2016 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dtVFRk\">Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War</a> by Fred Kaplan. I've enjoyed several of his previous books, and he interviewed and cited me for the text.Mr. Kaplan explained how General Michael Hayden, <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/104763/general-michael-v-hayden/\">NSA director from March 1999 to April 2005</a>, named the unit, as part of a general reorganization effort. Thanks to <a href=\"https://cryptome.org/nsa-reorg-id.htm\">Cryptome and FOIA requests by </a><i><a href=\"https://cryptome.org/nsa-reorg-id.htm\">Inside Defense</a> </i>we can read the October 1999 report recommending organizational changes. That reorganization was the genesis for creating TAO.<b>Kaplan on Creating TAO</b><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8BkQdUGy-jw/YGXsVilrG4I/AAAAAAABLBE/Axa-_eWPbWsoiT2pW6Q2H0jiwxTChtSqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1392/naming%2Btao.jpg\"></a>External Team Report Recommended Organization, 22 October 1999, Cryptome<br />This document, titled <a href=\"https://cryptome.org/nsa-reorg-et.htm\">EXTERNAL TEAM REPORT: A Management Review for the Director, NSA, October 22, 1999</a> mentions the need to reorganize the \"Signals Intelligence Mission (SIM)\" into \"three offices, Global Response, <b>Tailored Access</b> and Global Network.\" The <a href=\"https://cryptome.org/nsa-reorg-id.htm\">October 2000 public news story by Inside Defense about the reorganization</a> implies that it did not happen overnight. Mr. Kaplan notes that General Hayden initiated his \"One Hundred Days of Change\" program on 15 November 1999. A three-day server crash in January 2000 hampered reform efforts, prompting big changes in NSA approaches to computing. However, TAO was eventually operating some time in 2000. Mr. Kaplan notes the following in his book:\"It began, even under his expansion, as a small outfit: a few dozen computer programmers who had to pass an absurdly difficult exam to get in. The organization soon grew into an elite corps as secretive and walled off from the rest of the NSA as the NSA was from the rest of the defense establishment. Located in a separate wing of Fort Meade, <b>it was the subject of whispered rumors, but little solid knowledge, even among those with otherwise high security clearances...</b>Early on, TAO hacked into computers in fairly simple ways: phishing for passwords (one such program tried out every word in the dictionary, along with variations and numbers, in a fraction of a second) or sending emails with alluring attachments, which would download malware when opened. Once, some analysts from the Pentagon’s Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations were invited to Fort Meade for a look at TAO’s bag of tricks. The analysts laughed: this wasn’t much different from the software they’d seen at the latest DEF CON Hacking Conference; some of it seemed to be repackaged versions of the same software. Gradually, though, the TAO teams sharpened their skills and their arsenal.\"It's clear from this passage that TAO started as a small unit that conducted less exotic operations. It was difficult to join, but a far cry from the powerhouse it would soon become. It's also clear that knowledge of this organization was tightly controlled. Even the term \"tailored access\" was not associated publicly with NSA until the October 2000 reporting by Inside Defense, reproduced by Cryptome.Minihan's Role<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_xZiq0xroDY/YGXx0c51VTI/AAAAAAABLBY/vVlE17zt_WsNg-6G_Q7FbPIaVHJwsURmACLcBGAsYHQ/s2000/cover.jpg\"></a><i>Dark Territory</i> by Fred Kaplan<br />Circling back to the mention of 1997 in Mr. Aid's article, we do find the following in Mr. Kaplan's reporting:\"Fort Meade’s would be the third box on the new SIGINT organizational chart—“tailored access.”[Lt Gen Kenneth] <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/106229/lieutenant-general-kenneth-a-minihan/\">Minihan</a> [NSA director 1996-1999] had coined the phrase. During his tenure as director, he pooled a couple dozen of the most creative SIGINT operators into their own corner on the main floor and gave them that mission. What CIA black-bag operatives had long been doing in the physical world, the tailored access crew would now do in cyberspace, sometimes in tandem with the black-baggers, if the latter were needed—as they had been in Belgrade—to install some device on a crucial piece of hardware.The setup transformed the concept of signals intelligence, the NSA’s stock in trade. SIGINT had long been defined as passively collecting stray electrons in the ether; now, it would also involve actively breaking and entering into digital machines and networks.Minihan had wanted to expand the tailored access shop into an A Group of the digital era, but he ran out of time. When Hayden launched his reorganization, he took the baton and turned it into a distinct, elite organization—the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO.\"This reporting indicates that there was a tailored access group operating at NSA prior to General Hayden, but it was not actually named \"TAO\" and was not as large or exotic as what was to come.Conclusion<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-es8rhdmg_1w/YGX2sxdG4BI/AAAAAAABLBk/FPQZqc5NoQ8naaopzp5Qn84pnpZdiZhtwCLcBGAsYHQ/s158/tao%2Binside.jpg\"></a>\"Tao inside,\" TAO's play on the Intel Inside marketing campaign<br />To summarize, General Hayden assigned the name TAO to a group inside NSA in late 2000, months after I registered the TaoSecurity domain name. Although General Minihan had created a tailored access group during his tenure, the existence of that team, as well as what was later formally called TAO, was a close-held secret. The term \"tailored access\" did not appear in the public until Inside Defense's reporting of October 2000. Although I worked in the unit (Air Intelligence Agency) that served as the cryptologic service group for NSA (the Air Force contribution to the agency), I was not aware of any tailored access teams when I chose TaoSecurity as the name for my repository of security ideas. I selected TaoSecurity to reflect my interest in Taoism, and it had nothing to do with TAO or the NSA.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Now, after re-reading over 3,000 stories and approximately one million words, he has selected and republished the very best entries from 17 years of writing, along with commentaries and additional material. <br />In the third volume of the TaoSecurity Blog series, Mr. Bejtlich addresses the evolution of his security mindset, influenced by current events and advice from his so-called set of \"wise people.\" He talks about why speed is not the key to John Boyd's OODA loop, and why security strategies designed for and by the \"security 1%\" may be irrelevant at best, or harmful at worst, for the remaining \"99%\". His history section explores the origins of the terms threat hunting and indicators of compromise, and reveals who really created the quote \"there are two types of companies.\" His chapter on law highlights traps that might catch security teams, with advice to chief information security officers.<br />This volume contains some of Mr. Bejtlich’s favorite posts, such as Marcus Ranum's answer to what happens when security teams confront professionals, or how the Internet continues to function despite constant challenges, or reactions to comments by Dan Geer, Bruce Schneier, Marty Roesch, and other security leaders. Mr. Bejtlich has written new commentaries to accompany each post, some of which would qualify as blog entries in their own right.  Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve national security have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.<br />Writing the Series<br />Although I had written and self-published a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36dDR9H\">book in early 2019</a>, I had used <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/b/9204875-reach-your-goal-collector-s-edition\">Blurb</a> and stayed in print format. <br />For this new project, I wanted to publish \"reflowable\" (not print replica) Kindle editions, along with print versions, through Amazon. <br />I started the project in September 2019 by labelling 300 or so out of the 3,050 blog posts as candidates for inclusion in a \"best of\" book. I quickly realized that \"only\" 300 posts, plus new material and commentary, would result in a very large project, so I decided to break it into three volumes.<br />I created twelve categories and began sorting and commenting on the posts in March 2020. I decided to assign four categories to each volume, with an \"appendices\" category for the last volume if necessary.<br />I chose the 5.5 inch by 8.5 inch \"statement\" print size since it was supported by Google Docs and was a standard print size for Amazon.<br />Eventually I selected almost 375 posts for the book and began the real work!<br />I published <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GFNXat\">volume 1</a> in May 2020. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3paOEKg\">print edition</a> features 85,030 words in 357 pages, or about 238 words per page. <br />I published <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36fnTMe\">volume 2</a> in September 2020. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UjskQJ\">print edition</a> features 96,288 words in 429 pages, or about 224 words per page<br />Now, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/369jZEo\">volume 3</a> has arrived in November 2020. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n8LODF\">print edition</a> features 90,190 words in 485 pages, or about 185 words per page.<br />In total, the project resulted in 271,508 words over 1,271 pages, or about 214 words per page.<br />What's Next?<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BZOew2-EM8g/X6gOX_U2djI/AAAAAAABFVg/4Z20IFZtN_0p0kCDDySoE9E-a55nVUIJACLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/Beyond%2BTaoSecurity%2BBlog%252C%2BVolume%2B1.png\"></a><br /><br />Originally I wanted to add a few items outside TaoSecurity Blog to the third volume, in a section called \"Appendices.\" As I discovered and collected this material, I realized that adding it would essentially double the size of the third volume. As it was over 400 pages at that time, I decided I would save most of this material for another project.<br />That other project is <b>Beyond TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 1: Columns, Papers, PhD Work, and Testimonies. </b>At the moment, I believe I have a handle on what to include in that title. I don't expect to have a volume 2, but I thought it best to give this a volume number as I may have more material to publish in the future.<br />My goal is to publish this \"Beyond\" book during the next few weeks -- perhaps during or after Thanksgiving. <br />Conclusion<br />I wrote this series of books because I fear that this blog has become too unwieldy for its own good. Revisiting 17 years of posts, adding commentaries, and collecting related material has helped me better understand my own journey in security. The new \"Beyond\" book reaches a bit farther past the three blog volumes and includes material never before published, primarily from my abandoned PhD effort. I'll have more to say when I published that book before the end of the year.<br />If you've read any of the books in the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3p7Z3qb\">TaoSecurity Blog series</a>, I would great appreciate a positive review!

		"content": "There's a good chance that if you're reading this post, you're the member of an exclusive club. I call it the security one percent, or the <b>security 1% </b>or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23securityonepercent\">#securityonepercent</a> on Twitter. This is shorthand for the assortment of people and organizations who have the personnel, processes, technology, and support to implement somewhat robust digital security programs, especially those with the detection and response capabilities and not just planning and resistance/\"prevention\" functions. <br />Introduction <br />This post will estimate the size of the security 1% in the United States. It will then briefly explain how the security strategies of the 1% might be irrelevant at best or damaging at worse to the 99%.<br />A First Cut with FIRST<br />It's difficult to measure the size of the security 1%, but not impossible. My goal is to ascertain the correct orders of magnitude. <br />One method is to review entities who are members of the <a href=\"https://www.first.org/members/teams/\">Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, or FIRST</a>. FIRST is an organization to which high-performing computer incident response teams (CIRTs) may apply once their processes and data handling meet standards set by FIRST. <br />I learned of FIRST when the AFCERT was a member in the late 1990s. I also assisted with FIRST duties when Foundstone was a member in the early 2000s. I helped or sponsored membership when I worked at General Electric in the 2000s and Mandiant in the 2010s. I encourage all capable security teams to join FIRST.<br />Being a FIRST member means having a certain degree of incident response and data handling capability, and it signals to the world and to other FIRST teams that the member entity is serious about incident detection and response.<br />As of the writing of this post, there are 540 FIRST teams worldwide. Slightly more than 100 of them are based in the United States. <br />To put that in perspective, there are less than 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US. That means that <b>even if every single US FIRST member represented a publicly traded company</b> -- and that is not the case -- <b>FIRST representation for US publicly traded companies is only 2.5%</b>. <br />Beyond FIRST<br />Some of you might claim FIRST membership is no big deal. My current employer, Corelight, isn't a member, you might say. <br />Perhaps you could argue that for every US FIRST member, there are 9 others which have equivalent or better security teams. That would increase the cadre of entities with respectable detection and response capabilities from 100 to 1,000. That would still mean an <b>estimate that says 75% of publicly traded US companies have sub-par or non-existent security programs.</b><br />Remember that we've only been talking about a population of 4,000 publicly traded US companies. The US Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council estimates that there were <b>5.6 million employer firms in the United States in 2016.</b> Let's sadly reduce that to 4 million to account for the devastation of Covid. <br />(This reduction actually makes the situation actually look better for security, as terrible as it is either way. In other words, if I used a denominator of 5.6 million and not 4 million, security estimates would be 40% worse.)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IYoG2n_Bu-c/X521tGQ3fZI/AAAAAAABFJw/nBW3HuDl9Ochg6lRiegxwwStZhpoKVM8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s2043/capture_004_31102020_150603.png\"></a>Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council<br /><br />Let's be really generous and assume that only 1 in 100 of those 4 million businesses have any sensitive data. (That's again very generous.) <br />That leaves us with 400,000 entities with data worth defending. (Again, all of these estimates make it look like we're doing better than we actually are. The reality is probably a lot worse.)<br />Remember that we only had 100 US teams in FIRST, and we assumed an incredible 10-to-1 ratio to add another 900 non-FIRST organizations to the list of entities with decent security.<br />Now let's be generous again and assume a 4-to-1 ratio, such that for every 1 team in the publicly traded world there are 3 in the private world that also have decent security.<br /><b>This creates a total of 4,000 US organizations with decent security, out of 400,000 that need it. Those 4,000 are the security 1%.</b><br />If you think of the \"best of the best,\" there's probably only about <b>40 US security teams that qualify as global leaders and innovators</b>. These are the teams that can stand toe-to-toe with most foes, and still struggle due to the nature of the security challenge. You and I could probably name them: Lockheed Martin, Google, General Electric, etc.<br />That group of 40 is the 1% of the 1%, being 40 of the 4,000 of the 400,000. <b>These 40 are the US .01%.</b><br />If you think I'm being too conservative with only 40 teams, then feel free to increase it to 400. I'd be really curious to see someone compile a list of 400 world-beating security teams. That would still mean <b>that US group of 400 is the .1%.</b><b><br /></b>Sanity Check: A Few Statistics<br />To give you a sense of my numbers, and whether they are of the right order of magnitude at least, here are a few statistics:<br />1. The 2020 <i>Accenture Security Third Annual State of Cyber Resilience Report</i> featured responses from 4,644 \"executives,\" This is the same order of magnitude of my estimates here, diluted due to a global perspective. (In other words, there are actually less US executives responding to this survey due to the global respondent pool.)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzYhiW21CR0/X52uAM57zDI/AAAAAAABFJA/_9tSloZlapIPyRrgNqzhH_dIvhbSScMaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/capture_001_31102020_143246.png\"></a>2020 <i>Accenture Security Third Annual State of Cyber Resilience Report</i>, p 46<br /><br />2. The 2021 <i>PWC Global Digital Trust Insights Report</i> featured responses from \"3,249 business and technology executives around the world.\" This is again the same order of magnitude, again diluted due to global responses.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AVqFpkpEygI/X52x8z-XwQI/AAAAAAABFJk/kbQcGnwFr2IdnloYZ0VdB2BZWKhwHaymQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1651/capture_003_31102020_144757.png\"></a>2021 <i>PWC Global Digital Trust Insights Report</i>, Web summary<br /><br />3. A 2019 report by Bitglass found that 38% of the Fortune 500 do not have a CISO. That's 190 publicly traded companies! Hopefully it's less in 2020. Let's be crazy and assume the CISO count is 400 out of 500?<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7wPJsxoGVg/X52vRAmWfFI/AAAAAAABFJM/WfJiQ8UWnxYqahKESNI7gLwfVstVSFgnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s650/bitglass-ciso-092019.jpg\"></a>2019 Bitglass Report<br /><br />4. The Verizon <i>DBIR</i> featured reporting from 81 entities, the highest number in the history of the report. I do not know how many are in the US, but it's obviously less than 100, so the order of magnitude is again preserved. In other words, of the 4,000 capable security organizations in the US, less than 2.5% of them contributed to the <i>DBIR</i>. That would be less than 100, or the number of US FIRST teams.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JkqI_HCfjNM/X52w46CPJiI/AAAAAAABFJY/Ra2hgiNlAUUrQNbTWtS2b__lstCDdBO7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2809/capture_002_31102020_144516.png\"></a>2020 Verizon <i>DBIR </i>Report<br /><br />Remember that my focus here is the United States. This means the numbers from PWC, Accenture, and Verizon need to be reduced because they represent global audiences. However, the original FIRST count of roughly 100 American entities, and the statistic about the Fortune 500, which is just American companies, are already appropriately sized.<br />Security and the One Percent<br />What do these numbers mean for security? <br />Speaking first just for the US, it means that most of the conversations among security practitioners on Twitter, in mailing lists, during Webinars, within classes, and other gatherings of people take place within a very small grouping. <b>These are the 1%</b> that are part of the roughly 4,000 entities in the US that have a decent security capability. <br /><b>If those are the 1%, it means that the 99% are not included in these discussions.</b><br />This means that free threat intelligence, or free classes, or free post-exploitation security tools, or other free capabilities <b>mean nothing, or almost nothing to those 99% of organizations that do not have security capabilities</b>, or whose capabilities are so low or stretched that they cannot take advantage of whatever the 1% offers.<br />An Analogy: Personal Finance<br />I almost became a certified financial planner. Had I not secured a job in the AFCERT, I planned to separate from the Air Force, earn my CFP designation, and advise people on how to manage their assets and prepare for retirement. <br />I've come to realize that discussions I witness in the \"security community\" are like the discussions I see  in the finance community. It requires taking a big step back to appreciate this situation.<br />People at the 1% level in finance want to know how to manage their stock options, or how to save money for their child's college tuition through specialized savings vehicle, or, at the highest ends, how to move assets throughout \"Moneyland\" in pursuit of ever lower taxes. <br />These concerns are light-years away from the person who has a few dollars saved in an employer-provided 401(k) program, or who has little to no savings whatsoever.  <br /><br />The Consequences of the Security One Percent<br />So what's the big deal?<b><br /></b><b>The consequence of the existence and mindshare dominance of the security 1% is that the strategies and tactics they employ may work for the 1%, but not the 99%.</b> <br />I'm not talking about the \"rich\" preying on the \"poor.\" That's neither my message nor my philosophical outlook. <br />Rather, I mean that <b>methods that the security 1% use to defend themselves are irrelevant at best to the 99%, and damaging at worst to the 99%.</b><br />An example of irrelevance would be providing free indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other forms of threat intelligence. It's well-meaning but ultimately of no help to the 99%. If an entity in the 99% has a rudimentary security capability, or essentially zero security capability, threat intelligence is irrelevant.<br />An example of damage would be publication of post-exploitation security tools, or PESTs. The 1% may have the ability to use such tools to equip their red or penetration testing teams, determining if the countermeasures implemented by their blue team can resist or detect and respond to their simulated and later actual attacks. The 99%, however, have little to no ability to leverage PESTs. <b>They end up simply being victims when actual intruders use PESTs to pillage the 99%'s assets.</b><br />Conclusion<br />Readers can argue with my numbers. These are estimates, yes, but I believe I've gotten the orders of magnitude right, at least in the US. It's probably worse overseas, especially in the developing world. <br />The point of this exercise is to propose the idea that <b>the benefits of certain activities that may accrue to the 1% may be, and likely are, irrelevant and/or damaging to the 99%.</b><b><br /></b>In brief:<b><br /></b><b>I challenge the security 1% to first recognize their elite status, and second, to think how their beliefs and actions affect the 99% -- especially for the worse.</b><br />As this is a wicked problem, there is no easy answer. That may be worth a future blog post.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

		"content": "<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-98j4l3PuIJY/X5Lkc3MRlLI/AAAAAAABE9E/MmsGZ8Mes2kXgZqYjUxC3CisUL_EzAUDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1016/on%2Btactics.jpg\"></a><br />Just what are \"tactics\"?<br />Introduction<br /><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> is a great resource, but something about it has bothered me since I first heard about it several years ago. It's a minor point, but I wanted to document it in case it confuses anyone else.<br />The <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/docs/ATTACK_Design_and_Philosophy_March_2020.pdf\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Design and Philosophy</a> document from March 2020 says the following:<br /><i>At a high-level, ATT&amp;CK is a behavioral model that consists of the following core components:</i><i><br /></i><i>• Tactics, denoting short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack;</i><i>• Techniques, describing the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals;</i><i>• Sub-techniques, describing more specific means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals at a lower level than techniques; and</i><i>• Documented adversary usage of techniques, their procedures, and other metadata.</i><br />My concern is with MITRE's definition of \"tactics\" as \"short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack,\" which is oddly recursive.<br />The key word in the tactics definition is <b>goals</b>. According to MITRE, \"tactics\" are \"goals.\"<br />Examples of ATT&amp;CK Tactics<br />ATT&amp;CK lists the following as \"<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/\">Enterprise Tactics</a>\":<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sgfJU4xVNF8/X5LQX_FrqZI/AAAAAAABE8s/Wy5ifE75Q5wJhSC4x6PPNKBexROc6sHhwCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/capture_001_23102020_084057.jpg\"></a>MITRE ATT&amp;CK \"Tactics,\" https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/<br />Looking at this list, the first 11 items could indeed be seen as <b>goals</b>. The last item, Impact, is not a goal. That item is an artifact of trying to shoehorn more information into the ATT&amp;CK structure. That's not my primary concern though.<br />Military Theory and Definitions<br />As a service academy graduate who had to sit through many lectures on military theory, and who participated in small unit exercises, the idea of tactics as \"goals\" does not make any sense.<br />I'd like to share three resources that offer a different perspective on tactics. Although all three are military, my argument does not depend on that association.<br />The <a href=\"https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/dictionary.pdf\">DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms</a> defines tactics as \"the <b>employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other. </b>See also procedures; techniques. (CJCSM 5120.01)\" (emphasis added)<br />In his book <i>On Tactics</i>, B. A. Friedman defines tactics as \"the <b>use </b>of military forces to achieve victory over opposing enemy forces over the short term.\" (emphasis added)<br />Dr. Martin van Creveld, scholar and author from the military strategy world, wrote the excellent <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/tactics\">Encyclopedia Britannica entry on tactics</a>. His article includes the following:<br />\"Tactics, in warfare, the art and science of fighting battles on land, on sea, and in the air. It is concerned with the approach to combat; the disposition of troops and other personalities; the use made of various arms, ships, or aircraft; and the execution of movements for attack or defense...<br />The word tactics originates in the Greek <i>taxis</i>, meaning <b>order, arrangement, or disposition -- including the kind of disposition in which armed formations used to enter and fight battles. </b>From this, the Greek historian Xenophon derived the term <i>tactica</i>, the art of drawing up soldiers in array. Likewise, the <i>Tactica</i>, an early 10th-century handbook said to have been written under the supervision of the Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise, dealt with formations as well as weapons and the <b>ways of fighting</b> with them.<br />The term tactics fell into disuse during the European Middle Ages. It reappeared only toward the end of the 17th century, when “Tacticks” was used by the English encyclopaedist John Harris to mean 'the Art of <b>Disposing </b>any Number of Men into a proposed form of Battle...'\"<br />From these three examples, it is clear that tactics are about use and disposition of forces or capabilities during engagements. Goals are entirely different. <b>Tactics are the methods by which leaders achieve goals. </b><b><br /></b>How Did This Happen?<br />I was not a fly on the wall when the MITRE team designed ATT&amp;CK. Perhaps the MITRE team fixated on the phrase\"tactics, techniques, and procedures,\" or \"TTPs,\" again derived from military examples, when they were designing ATT&amp;CK? TTPs became hot during the 2000s as incident responders drew with military experience drew on that language when developing concepts like <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-origin-of-term-indicators-of.html\">indicators of compromise</a>. That fixation might have led MITRE to use \"tactics\" for their top-level structure. <br />It would have made more sense for MITRE to have just said \"goal\" or \"objective,\" but \"GTP\" isn't recognized by the digital defender world.<br />It's Not Just the Military<br />Some readers might think \"ATT&amp;CK isn't a military tool, so your military examples don't apply.\" I use the military references to show that the word tactic does have military origins, like the word \"strategy,\" from the Greek <i>Strategos </i>or <i>strategus</i>, plural <i>strategoi</i>, (Greek: στρατηγός, pl. στρατηγοί; Doric Greek: στραταγός, <i>stratagos</i>; meaning \"army leader\"). <br />That said, I would be surprised to see the word tactics used as \"goals\" anywhere else. For example, none of these examples from the non-military world involve tactics as goals:<br />This <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1987/11/strategy-vs-tactics-from-a-venture-capitalist\">Harvard Business Review article</a> defines tactics as \"the day-to-day and month-to-month decisions required to manage a business.\" <br />This <a href=\"https://www.omha.net/news_article/show/590082\">guide for ice hockey coaches</a> mentions tactics like \"give and go’s, crossing attacks, cycling the puck, chipping the puck to space and overlapping.\"<br />The <a href=\"https://www.thehartford.com/business-insurance/strategy/first-marketing-plan/marketing-tactics\">guide for small business marketing</a> lists tactics like advertising, grass-roots efforts, trade shows, website optimization, and email and social marketing.<br />In the civilian world, tactics are how leaders achieve goals or objectives.<br />Conclusion<br />In the big picture, it doesn't matter that much to ATT&amp;CK content that MITRE uses the term \"tactics\" when it really means \"goals.\" <br />However, I wrote this article because the ATT&amp;CK design and philosophy emphasizes a common language, e.g., ATT&amp;CK \"succinctly organizes adversary tactics and techniques along with providing a <b>common language</b> used across security disciplines.\"<br />If we want to share a common language, it's important that we recognize that the ATT&amp;CK use of the term \"tactics\" is an anomaly. Perhaps a future edition will change the terminology, but I doubt it given how entrenched it is at this point.<br /><b>Update</b>: This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyb1512/status/1319661359940984834\">Tweet from Matt Brady</a> made this point:<br />\"Agreed - for example, supply chain compromise is a tactic used for initial access, whereas software supply chain compromise (ShadowHammer) is a specific technique.\"Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

		"content": " <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5JbRi2XMXHw/X4HL1Vb_4_I/AAAAAAABEyY/4nWwFCEfyhMHtzZNkivGHNfEW2idreH6ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1691/capture_001_10102020_105629.jpg\"></a><br /><br />I was so pleased to read this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregRattray_/status/1314650788984229889\">Tweet</a> yesterday from Greg Rattray:<br />\"<b>Back in 2007, I coined the term “Advanced Persistent Threat” to characterize emerging adversaries that we needed to work with the defense industrial base to deal with</b>... Since then both the APT term and the nature of our adversaries have evolved. What hasn’t changed is that in cyberspace, advanced attackers will persistently go after targets with assets they want, no matter the strength of defenses.\"<br />Background<br />First, some background. Who is Greg Rattray?<br />First, you could call him Colonel or Doctor. I will use Col as that was the last title I used with him, although these days when we chat I call him Greg. <br />Col Rattray served 21 years in the Air Force and also earned his PhD in international security from Tufts University. His thesis formed the content for his 2001 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36NJY6t\">Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace</a>, which I reviewed in 2002 and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR0C0U97V748M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0262182092\">rated 4 stars</a>. (Ouch -- I was a bit stingy with the stars back then. I was more of an operator and less of a theorist or historian in those days. Such was my bias I suppose.)<br />Col Rattray is also a 1984 graduate of the Air Force Academy. He studied history and political science there and returned as an assistant professor in the early 1990s. He was one of my instructors when I was a cadet there. (I graduated in 1994 with degrees in history and political science.) Col Rattray then earned a master of public policy degree at Harvard Kennedy School. (I did the same, in 1996.) <br />Do you see a pattern here? He is clearly a role model. Of course, I did not stay in the Air Force as long, earn the same rank, or survive my PhD program!<br />After the Academy, Col Rattray served as commander of the 23rd Information Operations Squadrons on Security Hill in San Antonio, Texas. I was working in the AFCERT at the time. <br />One of the last duties I had in uniform was to travel to Nellis AFB outside Las Vegas and participate in a doctrine writing project for information warfare. At the time I was not a fan of the idea, but Col Rattray convinced me someone needed to write down how we did computer network defense in the AFCERT. <br />He didn't order me to participate, which I always appreciated. Years later I told him it was a good idea to organize that project and that I was probably just grumpy because of the way the Air Force personnel system had treated me at the end of my military career.<br />Why The Tweet Matters<br />For years I've had to dance around the issue of who invented the term \"APT.\" In most narratives I say that an Air Force colonel invented the term in 2006. I based this on discussions I had with colleagues in the defense industrial base who were working with said colonel and his team from the Air Force. I did not know back then that it was Col Rattray and his team from the Air Force Information Warfare Center. <br />Years later I learned of Rattray's role, but not directly from him. Only this year did Col Rattray confirm to me that he had invented the term, and that 2007 was the correct year. I encouraged him to say something, because as an historian I appreciate the value of facts and narrative. As I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taosecurity/status/1314662363233165314\">Tweeted</a> after seeing Greg's Tweet:<br />\"Security, like any other field, has HISTORY, which means there are beginnings, and stories, and discoveries, and innovators, and leaders, and first steps, and pioneers. I'm so pleased to see people like @GregRattray_ feel comfortable enough after all these years to say something.\"I don't think many people in the security field think about history. Security tends to be obsessed with the \"new\" and the \"shiny.\" Not enough people wonder how we got to this point, or what decisions led to the current situation. The security scene in 2020 is very different from the scene in 1960, or 1970, or 1980, or 1990, or 2000, or even 2010. This is not the time to describe how or why that is the case. I'm just glad a very important piece of the puzzle is now public.<br />More on the APT<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NFfk1OEcfek/X4HS5tyhEYI/AAAAAAABEzE/3d2Zb9MDvaoxcJLooqS_rcJepGQY5PukwCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/BoTB%2BDec%2B2020%2Bvol%2B3.jpg\"></a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about this history of the APT, check out my newest book -- <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GJt9yW\">The Best of TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 2</a>.

		"title": "The FBI Intrusion Notification Program",
		"content": "The FBI intrusion notification program is one of the most important developments in cyber security during the last 15 years. This program achieved mainstream recognition on 24 March 2014 when Ellen Nakashima reported on it for the Washington Post in her story <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140325052838/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/2014/03/24/74aff686-aed9-11e3-96dc-d6ea14c099f9_story.html\">U.S. notified 3,000 companies in 2013 about cyberattacks</a>. The story noted the following:\"Federal agents notified more than 3,000 U.S. companies last year that their computer systems had been hacked, White House officials have told industry executives, marking the first time the government has revealed how often it tipped off the private sector to cyberintrusions...About 2,000 of the notifications were made in person or by phone by the FBI, which has 1,000 people dedicated to cybersecurity investigations among 56 field offices and its headquarters. Some of the notifications were made to the same company for separate intrusions, officials said. Although in-person visits are preferred, resource constraints limit the bureau’s ability to do them all that way, former officials said...Officials with the Secret Service, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security that investigates financially motivated cybercrimes, said that they notified companies in 590 criminal cases opened last year, officials said. Some cases involved more than one company.\"The reason this program is so important is that it shattered the delusion that some executives used to reassure themselves. When the FBI visits your headquarters to tell you that you are compromised, you can't pretend that intrusions are \"someone else's problem.\"It may be difficult for some readers to appreciate how prevalent this mindset was, from the beginnings of IT to about the year 2010.I do not know exactly when the FBI began notifying victims, but I believe the mid-2000's is a safe date. I can personally attest to the program around that time.I was reminded of the importance of this program by Andy Greenberg's new story <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-hacking-victim-notifications/\">The FBI Botched Its DNC Hack Warning in 2016—but Says It Won’t Next Time</a>. I strongly disagree with this \"botched\" characterization. Andy writes:\"[S]omehow this breach [of the Democratic National Committee] had come as a terrible surprise—despite an FBI agent's warning to [IT staffer Yared] Tamene of potential Russian hacking over a series of phone calls that had begun fully nine months earlier.The FBI agent's warnings had 'never used alarming language,' Tamene would tell the Senate committee, and never reached higher than the DNC's IT director, who dismissed them after a cursory search of the network for signs of foul play.\"As with all intrusions, criminal responsibility lies with the intruder. However, I do not see why the FBI is supposed to carry the blame for how this intrusion unfolded. According to investigatory documents and this <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/\">Crowdstrike blog post</a> on their involvement, at least seven months passed from the time the FBI notified the DNC (sometime in September 2015) and when they contacted Crowdstrike (30 April 2016). That is ridiculous. If I received a call from the FBI even hinting at a Russian presence in my network, I would be on the phone with a professional incident response firm right after I briefed the CEO about the call.I'm glad the FBI continues to improve its victim notification procedures, but it doesn't make much of a difference if the individuals running IT and the organization are negligent, either through incompetence or inaction.<b>Note: Fixed year typo.</b>Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Print edition to follow.The book lists as having 413 pages (for the Kindle edition at least) at it's almost 95,000 words. I started working on it in June after finishing <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YSlmVt\">Volume 1</a>.Here is the book description:Since 2003, cybersecurity author Richard Bejtlich has been writing posts on TaoSecurity Blog, a site with 15 million views since 2011. Now, after re-reading over 3,000 posts and approximately one million words, he has selected and republished the very best entries from 17 years of writing. In the second volume of the TaoSecurity Blog series, Mr. Bejtlich addresses how to detect and respond to intrusions using third party threat intelligence sources, network data, application and infrastructure data, and endpoint data. He assesses government and private security initiatives and applies counterintelligence and counteradversary mindsets to defend digital assets. He documents the events of the last 20 years of Chinese hacking from the perspective of a defender on the front lines, in the pre- and post-APT era. This volume contains some of Mr. Bejtlich’s favorite posts, such as histories of threat hunting, so-called black and white hat budgeting, attribution capabilities and limits, and rating information security incidents. He has written new commentaries to accompany each post, some of which would qualify as blog entries in their own right.  Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve national security have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.I have a third volume planned. I will publish it by the end of the year. <br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ofg2qWIViiI/X0498WizfsI/AAAAAAABETA/c4g-vvla5xElSVmrtszMFaxZDJcJZ27gACLcBGAsYHQ/s1380/capture_001_18062020_154748.png\"></a><br />If you have any questions about the book, let me know.

		"content": "<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NDUaYxxTE9c/YC54161pT5I/AAAAAAABIok/Lyz65CtEMHY01n64_UlyKkG9bry49RTAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/scales%2Bcolor.jpg\"></a><br /><br /><br /><b>Proposition</b>Digital offense capabilities are currently net negative for the security ecosystem.[0]<br />The costs of improved digital offense currently outweigh the benefits. The legitimate benefits of digital offense accrue primarily to the <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2020/10/security-and-one-percent-thought.html\">security one percent</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/securityonepercent\">#securityonepercent</a>), and to intelligence, military, and law enforcement agencies. The derived defensive benefits depend on the nature of the defender. The entire security ecosystem bears the costs, and in some cases even those who see tangible benefit may suffer costs exceeding those benefits.<br />The ReasonLimitations of scaling are the reason why digital offense capabilities are currently net negative.<br />Consider the case of an actor developing a digital offense capability, and publishing it to the general public. <br /><b>From the target side, limitations on scaling prevent complete mitigation or remediation of the vulnerability.</b><br />The situation is much different from the offense perspective.<br /><b>Any actor may leverage the offense capability against any Internet-connected target on the planet. </b><br />The actor can scale that capability across the entire range of vulnerable or exposed targets.<br />The ThreeOnly three sets of actors are able to possibly leverage an offense capability for defensive purposes.<br />First, the<b> organization responsible for developing and maintaining the vulnerable or exposed asset</b> can determine if there is a remedy for the new offense capability. (This is typically a \"vendor,\" but could be a noncommercial entity. As a shorthand, I will use \"vendor.\") The vendor can try to develop and deploy a patch or mitigation method.<br />Second, <b>major consumers</b> of the vulnerable or exposed asset can take similar steps, usually by implementing the vendor's patch or mitigation.<br />Third, the <b>security one percent</b> can take some defensive measures, either by implementing the vendor's patch or mitigation, or by developing and acting upon detection and response processes.<br />The combination of the actions by these three sets of actors will not completely remediate the digital offense capability. The gap can be small, or it can be exceptionally large, hence the net negative cost to the digital ecosystem.<br />The InsightFrom the intruder side, little to no limitations on scaling mean the intruder can leverage the digital offense capability against all vulnerable targets.<b><br /></b>This is the key insight that produces digital offense capabilities as net negative for the entire security ecosystem:<br /><b>Offensive scale is superior to defensive scale.</b><br />Stated differently:<br />An intruder actor can leverage an offense capability against any vulnerable target.<br />Few (if any) defenders can leverage a derived defense capability against all vulnerable targets.<br />Those who object to this argument are likely one of the three actors.<br />Objections: Vendors<br />Vendors may have the strongest case for being able to scale defense, depending on the nature of the vendor's offering.<br />Vendors who provide software or other capabilities that require customer action for updates are in the weakest position. If customers do not update, they remain vulnerable.<br />Vendors who mandate automatic updating are in a stronger position. Customers receive the update, with the effectiveness of the update mechanism being the major limitation.<br />Vendors who operate \"as a service\" offerings, such as the major cloud and email providers, are in the strongest position. They can silently improve their offering without user involvement. They can scale defense across their service as they more or less completely control it.<br />Objections: Major Consumers<br />Major consumers may operate with or without the involvement or action of vendors. When the major consumer is operating an on-premise instance, for example, they can be in a position to implement a mitigation or remediation. Such major consumers have teams that qualify them as being in the security one percent, so in some ways this dual-counts the defensive benefit.<br />Some major consumers may remain vulnerable, however, regardless of their relative size or nature. The SolarWinds case has shown that organizations with multi-billion-dollar information technology budgets can be as helpless as those outside the security one percent.<br />Objections: The Security One PercentThe security one percent is likely to voice the loudest objections. The security one percent are individuals working in entities with the budget to fund a blue (defense) team, and probably a red (offense) team.<br />As mentioned in a <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2020/10/security-and-one-percent-thought.html\">previous blog post</a>, the security one percent can use offensive tools to equip their red or penetration testing teams. Those teams, nonexistent outside the security one percent, can work with or against blues team to determine if countermeasures are effective. <br />The security one percent is generally oblivious to their privilege. I was personally not aware of this mindset until the rise of ransomware in 2018-2020. <br />The exceptions are two-fold. One group who is aware of their privilege comes from \"the other side of the tracks.\" They worked for an entity without a security team, perhaps in a non-IT role, or a non-security role. Another exception involves people who volunteer or consult with entities outside the security one percent. They see the gap between their own capabilities and those they are trying to help. <br />One portion of the security one percent is particularly critical: those who rely upon offense for their income, or enjoy it as a hobby. They reject any sentiment or policy prescription that threatens their livelihood or enjoyment, regardless of the larger societal cost. Addressing the concerns of this group requires a separate blog post.<br />SummaryThe difference in the capabilities of the <b>vendor/major consumer/security one percent triad</b> and the rest of the security ecosystem is the result of <b>defense failing to scale as effectively as offense</b>.<br />When an actor publicly releases a digital offensive capability, especially in the form of working code, generally any threat actor can leverage that capability against any vulnerable target.<br />The inverse is not true. Any defensive capability, derived from the offensive capability, can generally <b>not </b>be leveraged to protect any vulnerable target. <br />Free or open source tools, training, or knowledge are helpful, but they require deployment, tuning, comprehension, commitment, and a host of other capabilities that do not scale as effectively as offensive code. While using offensive code has a learning and operational curve, it is nowhere as steep as that facing defenders.<br />The strongest and most helpful exception is found in vendors who offer \"as a service\" capabilities. They can independently and comprehensively improve their security posture with little to no involvement from the vulnerable population. (An exception, for example, is offering, but not mandating, multi-factor authentication. Only by adopting MFA does the population improve its security.)ConclusionThe summary yields three conclusions:<br />1.<b> Limiting the availability of digital offense capabilities</b>, such that they are not public and within the reach of any threat actor, will likely limit offensive options for intruders, thereby increasing their operational costs to research, develop, deploy, and maintain offensive tools.<br />2. <b>Increasing the use and reliance upon \"as a service\" offerings</b> will likely improve the security of the ecosystem, as defensive measures can be scaled across the entire vulnerable population.<br />3. The rise of \"as a service\" offerings will likely <b>drive intruders to target those offerings directly</b>, rather than the independent assets distributed across the ecosystem.<br />There are no \"solutions\" in digital security -- only trade-offs.[1] <br />I am cautiously optimistic that some combination of the first two conclusions would offset the rise of the third conclusion, generating a net positive improvement in digital security. <br />Too many in the digital world have treated security as a technical problem with technical solutions. While technical matters play a role, the centrality of the digital ecosystem means that it should be treated as a public policy concern. That strategy is at least two decades overdue.<br />Please direct comments on this post to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taosecurity\">Twitter</a>.<br />Endnotes[0] I'm very confident this argument holds for <b>public digital offense capabilities</b>. After publishing this post I realized I assumed this perspective but did not make it explicit. Hence, this note.<br />[1] I derive this phrase from one of my public policy professors, Philip D. Zelikow, who noted that there are no solutions in public policy -- only trade-offs. Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I've been working on it since last year, but I've used the time in isolation to carry the first volume over the finish line.<br /><br />The Amazon.com description says:<br /><br />Since 2003, cybersecurity author Richard Bejtlich has been writing posts on TaoSecurity Blog, a site with 15 million views since 2011. Now, after re-reading over 3,000 posts and approximately one million words, he has selected and republished the very best entries from 17 years of writing.<br /><br />In the first volume of the TaoSecurity Blog series, Bejtlich addresses milestones, philosophy and strategy, risk, and advice. Bejtlich shares his thoughts on leadership, the intruder's dilemma, managing burnout, controls versus assessments, insider versus outsider threats, security return on investment, threats versus vulnerabilities, controls and compliance, the post that got him hired at a Fortune 5 company as their first director of incident response, and much more.<br /><br />He has written new commentaries to accompany each post, some of which would qualify as blog entries in their own right.  Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve career opportunities have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.<br /><br />Finally, if you're interested in subsequent volumes, I have two planned.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OeaTQaBEcbY/XrA3CAs0lMI/AAAAAAABAOA/fwVL_WsUpncbLQ7jeCVvaXx3IbxHMVnNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/capture_001_03052020_215637.png\"></a><br />I may also have a few other book projects in the pipeline. I'll have more to say on that in the coming weeks.<br /><br />If you have any questions about the book, let me know.

		"title": "COVID-19 Phishing Tests: WRONG",
		"content": "Malware Jake <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/1237871580094459907?s=20\">Tweeted</a> a poll last night which asked the following:<br /><br />\"I have an interesting ethical quandary. Is it ethically okay to use COVID-19 themed phishing emails for assessments and user awareness training right now? Please read the thread before responding and RT for visibility. 1/\"<br /><br />Ultimately he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/1237871592840949761?s=20\">decided</a>:<br /><br />\"My gut feeling is to not use COVID-19 themed emails in assessments/training, but to TELL users to expect them, though I understand even that might discourage consumption of legitimate information, endangering public health. 6/\"<br /><br />I responded by saying this was the right answer.<br /><br />Thankfully there were many people who agreed, despite the fact that voting itself was skewed towards the \"yes\" answer.<br /><br />There were an uncomfortable number of responses to the Tweet that said there's nothing wrong with red teams phishing users with COVID-19 emails. For example:<br /><br />\"Do criminals abide by ethics? Nope. Neither should testing.\"<br /><br />\"Yes. If it's in scope for the badguys [sic], it's in scope for you.\"<br /><br />\"Attackers will use it. So I think it is fair game.\"<br /><br />Those are the wrong answers. As a few others outlined well in their responses, the fact that a criminal or intruder employs a tactic does not mean that it's appropriate for an offensive security team to use it too.<br /><br />I could imagine several COVID-19 phishing lures that could target school districts and probably cause high double-digit click-through rates. What's the point of that? For a \"community\" that supposedly considers fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to be anathema, why introduce FUD via a phishing test?<br /><br />I've grown increasingly concerned over the past few years that there's a \"cult of the offensive\" that justifies its activities with the rationale that \"intruders do it, so we should too.\" This is directly observable in the replies to Jake's Tweet. It's a thin veneer that covers bad behavior, outweighing the small benefit accrued to high-end, 1% security shops against the massive costs suffered by the vast majority of networked global organizations.<br /><br />The is a selfish, insular mindset that is reinforced by the echo chamber of the so-called \"infosec community.\" This \"tribe\" is detached from the concerns and ethics of the larger society. It tells itself that what it is doing is right, oblivious or unconcerned with the costs imposed on the organizations they are supposedly \"protecting\" with their backwards actions.<br /><br />We need people with feet in both worlds to tell this group that their approach is not welcome in the broader human community, because the costs it imposes vastly outweigh the benefits.<br /><br />I've written here about <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\">ethics</a> before, usually in connection with the only real value I saw in the <a href=\"https://www.isc2.org/Ethics#\">CISSP -- its code of ethics</a>. Reviewing the \"code,\" as it appears now, shows the following:<br /><br />\"There are only four mandatory canons in the Code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional.<br /><br />Code of Ethics Preamble:<br /><br />The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other, requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.<br />Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.<br /><br />Code of Ethics Canons:<br /><br />Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.<br />Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.<br />Provide diligent and competent service to principals.<br />Advance and protect the profession.\"<br /><br />This is almost worthless. The only actionable item in the \"code\" is the word \"legally,\" implying that if a CISSP holder was convicted of a crime, he or she could lose their certification. Everything else is subject to interpretation.<br /><br />Contrast that with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet_Honor_Code#U.S._Air_Force_Academy\">USAFA Code of Conduct</a>:<br /><br />\"We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\"<br /><br />While it still requires an Honor Board to determine if a cadet has lied, stolen, cheated, or tolerated, there's much less gray in this statement of the Academy's ethics. Is it perfect? No. Is it more actionable than the CISSP's version? Absolutely.<br /><br />I don't have \"solutions\" to the ethical bankruptcy manifesting in some people practicing what they consider to be \"information security.\" However, this post is a step towards creating red lines that those who are not already hardened in their ways can observe and integrate.<br /><br />Perhaps at some point we will have an actionable code of ethics that helps newcomers to the field understand how to properly act for the benefit of the human community.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

		"title": "Seven Security Strategies, Summarized",
		"content": "This is the sort of story that starts as a comment on Twitter, then becomes a blog post when I realize I can't fit all the ideas into one or two Tweets. (You know how much I hate Tweet threads, and how I encourage everyone to capture deep thoughts in blog posts!)<br /><br />In the interest of capturing the thought, and not in the interest of thinking too deeply or comprehensively (at least right now), I offer seven security strategies, summarized.<br /><br />When I mention the risk equation, I'm talking about the idea that one can conceptually image the risk of some negative event using this \"formula\": Risk (of something) is the product of some measurements of Vulnerability X Threat X Asset Value, or R = V x T x A.<br /><br /><b>Denial and/or ignorance.</b> This strategy assumes the risk due to loss is low, because those managing the risk assume that one or more of the elements of the risk equation are zero or almost zero, or they are apathetic to the cost.<b>Loss acceptance. </b>This strategy may assume the risk due to loss is low, or more likely those managing the risk assume that the cost of risk realization is low. In other words, incidents will occur, but the cost of the incident is acceptable to the organization.<b>Loss transferal.</b> This strategy may also assume the risk due to loss is low, but in contrast with risk acceptance, the organization believes it can buy an insurance policy which will cover the cost of an incident, and the cost of the policy is cheaper than alternative strategies.<b>Vulnerability elimination. </b>This strategy focuses on driving the vulnerability element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through secure coding, proper configuration, patching, and similar methods.<b>Threat elimination.</b> This strategy focuses on driving the threat element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through deterrence, dissuasion, co-option, bribery, conversion, incarceration, incapacitation, or other methods that change the intent and/or capabilities of threat actors. <b>Asset value elimination.</b> This strategy focuses on driving the threat element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through minimizing data or resources that might be valued by adversaries.<b>Interdiction.</b> This is a hybrid strategy which welcomes contributions from vulnerability elimination, primarily, but is open to assistance from loss transferal, threat elimination, and asset value elimination. Interdiction assumes that <i>prevention eventually fails</i>, but that security teams can detect and respond to incidents <i>post-compromise and pre-breach</i>. In other words, some classes of intruders will indeed compromise an organization, but it is possible to detect and respond to the attack <i>before the adversary completes his mission.</i>As you might expect, I am most closely associated with the interdiction strategy. <br />I believe the denial and/or ignorance and loss acceptance strategies are irresponsible.<br />I believe the loss transferal strategy continues to gain momentum with the growth of cybersecurity breach insurance policies. <br />I believe the vulnerability elimination strategy is important but ultimately, on its own, ineffective and historically shown to be impossible. When used in concert with other strategies, it is absolutely helpful.<br />I believe the threat elimination strategy is generally beyond the scope of private organizations. As the state retains the monopoly on the use of force, usually only law enforcement, military, and sometimes intelligence agencies can truly <i>eliminate or mitigate </i>threats. (Threats are not vulnerabilities.)<br />I believe asset value elimination is powerful but has not gained the ground I would like to see. This is my \"<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/09/03/new-cybersecurity-mantra-if-you-cant-protect-it-dont-collect-it/\">If you can’t protect it, don’t collect it</a>\" message. The limitation here is obviously one's raw computing elements. If one were to magically strip down every computing asset into basic operating systems on hardware or cloud infrastructure, the fact that those assets exist and are networked means that any adversary can abuse them for mining cryptocurrencies, or as infrastructure for intrusions, or for any other uses of raw computing power.<br />Please notice that none of the strategies listed tools, techniques, tactics, or operations. Those are important but below the level of strategy in the conflict hierarchy. I may have more to say on this in the future. Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

The article proposes the following:<br /><br /><i>The United States and its allies and partners should stop worrying about the risk of authoritarians splitting the Internet. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>I</i><i>nstead, they should split it themselves, by creating a digital bloc within which data, services, and products can flow freely, excluding countries that do not respect freedom of expression or privacy rights, engage in disruptive activity, or provide safe havens to cybercriminals...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The league would not raise a digital Iron Curtain; at least initially, most Internet traffic would still flow between members and nonmembers, and the league would primarily block companies and organizations that aid and abet cybercrime, rather than entire countries. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Governments that fundamentally accept the idea of an open, tolerant, and democratic Internet but that struggle to live up to such a vision would have an incentive to improve their enforcement efforts in order join the league and secure connectivity for their companies and citizens. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Of course, authoritarian regimes in China, Russia, and elsewhere will probably continue to reject that vision. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Instead of begging and pleading with such governments to play nice, from now on, the United States and its allies should lay down the law: follow the rules, or get cut off.</i><br /><br />My i<a href=\"https://twitter.com/taosecurity/status/1166400211452870656\">nitial reaction</a> to this line of thought was not encouraging. Rather than continue exchanging Twitter messages, Rob and I had a very pleasant phone conversation to help each other understand our points of view. Rob asked me to document my thoughts in a blog post, so this is the result.<br /><br />Rob explained that the main goal of the IFL is to create leverage to influence those who do not implement an open, tolerant, and democratic Internet (summarized below as OTDI). I agree that leverage is certainly lacking, but I wondered if the IFL would accomplish that goal. My reservations included the following.<br /><br />1. Many countries that currently reject the OTDI might only be too happy to be cut off from the Western Internet. These countries do not want their citizens accessing the OTDI. Currently dissidents and others seeking news beyond their local borders must often use virtual private networks and other means to access the OTDI. If the IFL went live, those dissidents and others would be cut off, thanks to their government's resistance to OTDI principles.<br /><br />2. Elites in anti-OTDI countries would still find ways to access the Western Internet, either for personal, business, political, military, or intelligence reasons. The common person would be mostly likely to suffer.<br /><br />3. Segregating the OTDI would increase the incentives for \"network traffic smuggling,\" whereby anti-OTDI elites would compromise, bribe, or otherwise corrupt Western Internet resources to establish surreptitious methods to access the OTDI. This would increase the intrusion pressure upon organizations with networks in OTDI and anti-OTDI locations.<br /><br />4. Privacy and Internet freedom groups would likely strongly reject the idea of segregating the Internet in this manner. They are vocal and would apply heavy political pressure, similar to recent net neutrality arguments.<br /><br />5. It might not be technically possible to segregate the Internet as desired by the IFL. Global business does not neatly differentiate between Western and anti-OTDI networks. Similar to the expected resistance from privacy and freedom groups, I expect global commercial lobbies to strongly reject the IFL on two grounds. First, global businesses cannot disentangle themselves from anti-OTDI locations, and second, Western businesses do not want to lose access to markets in anti-OTDI countries.<br /><br />Rob and I had a wide-ranging discussion, but these five points in written form provide a platform for further analysis.<br /><br />What do you think about the IFL?

I did create the first taosecurity.com Web site shortly thereafter.<br />I first started hosting it on space provided by my then-ISP, Road Runner of San Antonio, TX. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20020201165209/http://home.satx.rr.com/bejtlich/\">According to archive.org, it looked like this in February 2002</a>.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TIH5wSDQu8I/XRoI6-zKE5I/AAAAAAAA788/TPa6XiAfQyoXuSwHtvx_z1GpnonNvwoVwCLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-200202.jpg\"></a><br />That is some fine-looking vintage hand-crafted HTML. Because I lived in Texas I apparently reached for the desert theme with the light tan background. Unfortunately I didn't have the \"under construction\" gif working for me.<br />As I got deeper into the security scene, I decided to simplify and adopt a dark look. By this time I had left Texas and was in the DC area, working for Foundstone. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030401085833/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/taosecurity/\">According to archive.org, the site look like this in April 2003</a>.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3TtjgTsiHfs/XRoJpBUJDcI/AAAAAAAA79E/aCUVsj2S9JkK_SBv90as6hwEJsNUoeYbwCLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-200304.jpg\"></a><br />Notice I've replaced the oh-so-cool picture of me doing American Kenpo in the upper-left-hand corner with the classic Bruce Lee photo from the cover of The Tao of Jeet Kune Do. This version marks the first appearance of my classic TaoSecurity logo.<br />A little more than two years later, I decided to pursue TaoSecurity as an independent consultant. To launch my services, I painstakingly created more hand-written HTML and graphics to deliver this beauty. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050519030526/http://www.taosecurity.com/\">According to archive.org, the site looked like this in May 2005</a>.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rImoOAPzy0Q/XRoKeHTUJzI/AAAAAAAA79M/m-hMno0wIogiB9Gmyqe-5f0lWQSCqa61ACLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-200505.jpg\"></a><br />I mean, can you even believe how gorgeous that site is? Look at the subdued gray TaoSecurity logo, the red-highlighted menu boxes, etc. I should have kept that site forever.<br />We know that's not what happened, because that wonder of a Web site only lasted about a year. Still to this day not really understanding how to use CSS, I used a free online template by Andreas Viklund to create a new site. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060721203353/http://www.taosecurity.com/\">According to archive.org, the site appeared in this form in July 2006</a>.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3f2dbOnAzqk/XRoLK1AFIII/AAAAAAAA79U/3YmZMJ5n8482Arl9rLfpcKBTsvfjef8ewCLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-200607.jpg\"></a><br />After four versions in four years, my primary Web site stayed that way... <b>for thirteen years</b>. Oh, I modified the content, SSH'ing into the server hosted by my friend Phil Hagen, manually editing the HTML using vi (and careful not to touch the CSS).<br />Then, I attended AWS re:inforce the last week in June, 2019. I decided that although I had <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/11/60-free-minutes-with-ubuntu-1010-in.html\">tinkered</a> <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/11/trying-ubuntu-1010-in-aws-free-usage.html\">with</a> Amazon Web Services as early as 2010, and was keeping an eye on it as early as <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/colin-percival-and-craig-balding-on.html\">2008</a>, I had never hosted any meaningful workloads there. A migration of my primary Web site to AWS seemed like a good way to learn a bit more about AWS and an excuse to replace my teenage Web layout with something that rendered a bit better on a mobile device.<br />After working with Mobirise, AWS S3, AWS Cloudfront, AWS Certificate Manager, AWS Route 53, my previous domain name servers, and my domain registrar, I'm happy to say I have a new <a href=\"https://taosecurity.com/\">TaoSecurity.com</a> Web site. The front page like this:<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vvI9VZ1BX64/XRoNNiA198I/AAAAAAAA79g/JJKStQ48fyMxSLig-NB60YJgraVI7bocACLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-201907.jpg\"></a><br />The background is an image of Milnet from the late 1990s. I apologize for the giant logo in the upper left. It should be replaced by a resized version later today when the AWS Cloudfront cache expires.<br />Scolling down provides information on my books, which I figured is what most people who visit the site care about.<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0aTaakwz_iI/XRoNnRjCPwI/AAAAAAAA79o/i05SRIRFbw4J3i2lEeX79l1QzkOrq6NqgCLcBGAs/s1600/taosecurity-201907b.jpg\"></a><br />For reference, I moved the content (which I haven't been updated) about <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2019/07/reference-taosecurity-news.html\">news</a>, <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2019/07/reference-taosecurity-press.html\">press</a>, and <a href=\"https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2019/07/reference-taosecurity-research.html\">research</a> to individual TaoSecurity Blog posts.<br />It's possible you will not see the site, if your DNS servers have the old IP addresses cached. That should all expire no later than tomorrow afternoon, I imagine.<br />Let's see if the new site lasts another thirteen years?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

'<b>There are nearly 800 Exchange 2010 servers that have never been updated</b>.'<br /><br />They also found <b>10,731 Exchange 2007 servers</b> and more than 166,321 Exchange 2010 ones, with the former<b> already running End of Support (EoS) software that hasn't received any security updates since 2017</b> and the latter reaching EoS in October 2020.\"<br /><br />In case you were wondering, <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nsa-warns-about-microsoft-exchange-flaw-as-attacks-start/\">threat actors have already been exploiting these flaws</a> for weeks, if not months.<br /><br />Email is one of, if not the most, sensitive and important systems upon which organizations of all shapes and sizes rely. The are, by virtue of their function, inherently exposed to the Internet, meaning they are within the range of every targeted or opportunistic intruder, worldwide.<br /><br />In this particular case, unpatched servers are also vulnerable to any actor who can download and update Metasploit, which is virtually 100% of them.<br /><br />It is the height of negligence to run such an important system in an unpatched state, when there are much better alternatives -- namely, outsourcing your email to a competent provider, like Google, Microsoft, or several others.<br /><br />I expect some readers are saying \"I would never put my email in the hands of those big companies!\" That's fine, and I know several highly competent individuals who run their own email infrastructure. The problem is that they represent the small fraction of individuals and organizations who can do so. Even being extremely generous with the numbers, it appears that less than 20%, and probably less than 15% according to other estimates, can even keep their Exchange servers patched, let alone properly configured.<br /><br />If you think it's still worth the risk, and your organization isn't able to patch, because you want to avoid megacorp email providers or government access to your email, you've made a critical miscalculation. You've essentially decided that it's more important for you to keep your email out of megacorp or government hands than it is to keep it from targeted or opportunistic intruders across the Internet.<br /><br />Incidentally, you've made another mistake. Those same governments you fear, at least many of them, will just leverage Metasploit to break into your janky email server anyway.<br /><br />The bottom line is that unless your organization is willing to commit the resources, attention, and expertise to maintaining a properly configured and patched email system, you should outsource it. Otherwise you are being negligent with not only your organization's information, but the information of anyone with whom you exchange emails.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I never use computer video, because I want to preserve the world's bandwidth. That means I don't share what my book shelves look like when I'm on a company call. Therefore, I thought I'd share my book shelves with the world.<br /><br />My big categories of books are martial arts, mixed/miscellaneous, cybersecurity and intelligence, and military and Civil War history. I've cataloged about 400 print books and almost 500 digital titles. Over the years I've leaned towards buying Kindle editions of any book that is mostly print, in order to reduce my footprint.<br /><br />For the last many years, my book shelving has consisted of three units, each with five shelves. Looking at the topic distribution, as of 2020 I have roughly 6 shelves for martial arts, 4 for mixed/miscellaneous, 3 for cybersecurity and intelligence, and 2 for military and Civil War history.<br /><br />This is interesting to me because I can compare my mix from five years ago, when I did an interview for the now defunct <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062402/http://www.warcouncil.org/warbooks/?author=54bb7722e4b095413a5b551f\">Warcouncil Warbooks project</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pTt2LDfK2IE/XoZsrw4EcPI/AAAAAAAA_kk/o2mZEVHKkMM49a7M4raZVSveaziJICUHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_0100.JPG\"></a><br />In that image from 2015, I can see 2 shelves for martial arts, 4 for mixed/miscellaneous, 7 for cybersecurity and intelligence, and 2 for military and Civil War history.<br /><br />What happened to all of the cybersecurity and intelligence books? I donated a bunch of them, and the rest I'm selling on Amazon, along with books (in new or like new condition) that my kids decided they didn't want anymore.<br /><br />I've probably donated hundreds, possibly approaching a thousand, cyber security and IT books over the years. These were mostly books sent by publishers, although some were those that I bought and no longer needed. Some readers from northern Virginia might remember me showing up at ISSA or NoVASec meetings with a boxes of books that I would leave on tables. I would say \"I don't want to come home with any of these. Please be responsible. And guess what -- everyone was!<br /><br />If anyone would like to share their book shelves, the best place would be as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taosecurity/status/1245849700386902018\">reply to my Tweet on this post</a>. I look forward to seeing your book shelves, fellow bibliophiles.<br /><br />Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

These are certainly unusual times.<br /><br />I was thinking about words to describe different skill levels in digital security. Rather than invent something, I decided to review terms that have established meaning. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Archives_of_Psychology/U6RGAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=novice+apprentice+journeyman+expert&amp;pg=RA2-PA12&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Google Books</a> I found this article in a 1922 edition of the Archives of Psychology that mentioned four key terms:<br /><br />The <b>novice </b>is a (person) who has no trade ability whatever, or at least none that could not be paralleled by practically any intelligent (person).An <b>apprentice </b>has acquired some of the elements of the trade but is not sufficiently skilled to be trusted with any important task.The <b>journey(person)</b> is qualified to perform almost any work done by members of the trade.An <b>expert </b>can perform quickly and with superior skill any work done by (people) in the trade.I believe these four categories can apply to some degree to the needs of the digital security profession.<br />At GE-CIRT we had three levels -- event analyst, incident analyst, and incident handler. We did not hire novices, so those three roles map in some ways to apprentice, journeyperson, and expert. <br />One difference with the classical description applies to how we worked with apprentices. We trusted apprentices, or event analysts, with specific tasks. We thought of this work as important, just as every role on a team is important. It may not have been leading an incident response, but without the work of the event and incident analysts, we may not have discovered many incidents!<br />Crucially, we encouraged event analysts, and incident analysts for that matter, to always be looking to <i>exceed the parameters</i> of their assigned duties.<br />However, we stipulated that if a person was working beyond their assigned duties, they had to have their work product reviewed by the next level of analysis. This enabled mentoring among the various groups. It also helped identify people who were candidates for promotion. If a person consistently worked beyond their assigned duties, and eventually reached a near-perfect or perfect ability to do that work, that proved he or she was ready to assume the next level.<br />This ability to access work beyond assigned duties is one reason I have problems with limiting data by role. I think everyone who works in a CIRT should have access to all of the data, assuming there are no classification, privacy, or active investigation constraints.<br />One of my laws is the following:<br /><b>Analysts are good because they have good data. An expert with bad data is helpless. An apprentice with good data has a chance to do good work.</b><b><br /></b>I've said it more eloquently elsewhere but this is the main point. <br />For more information on the apprenticeship model, this <a href=\"https://www.classicalu.com/the-apprenticeship-model-three-levels-to-mastery/\">article</a> might be useful.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I only use a thread, and no more than 2, and hardly ever 3 (good Lord), when I know I've got nothing more to say. \"1/10,\" \"1/n,\" etc. are not for me.\"<br /><br />Then I realized I had something more to say, namely, other reasons blog posts are better than Tweets. For the briefest moment I considered adding a second Tweet, making, horror of horrors, a THREAD, and then I realized I would be breaking my own guidance.<br /><br />Here are three reasons to consider blogging over Tweeting.<br /><br />1. If you find yourself trying to pack your thoughts into a 280 character limit, then you should write a blog post. You might have a good idea, and instead of expressing it properly, you're falling into the trap of <b>letting the medium define the message</b>, aka the PowerPoint trap. I learned this from Edward Tufte: <b>let the message define the medium</b>, not the other way around.<br /><br />2. Twitter threads lose the elegance and readability of the English language as our ancestors created it, for our benefit. They gave us structures, like sentences, lists, indentation, paragraphs, chapters, and so on. What does Twitter provide? 280 character chunks. Sure, you can apply feeble \"1/n\" annotations, but you've lost all that structure and readability, and for what?<br /><br />3. In the event you're writing a Tweet thread that's really worth reading, writing it via Twitter virtually guarantees that it's lost to history. Twitter is an abomination for citation, search, and future reference. In the hierarchy of delivering content for current researchers and future generations, the hierarchy is the following, from lowest to highest:<br /><br />\"Transient,\" \"bite-sized\" social media, e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. postsBlog postsWhitepapersAcademic papers in \"electronic\" journalsElectronic (e.g., Kindle) only formatted booksPrint books (that may be stand-alone works, or which may contain journal articles)<br />Print book are the apex communication medium because we have such references going back hundreds of years. Hundreds of years from now, I doubt the first five formats above will be easily accessible, or accessible at all. However, in a library or personal collection somewhere, printed books will endure.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you think what you're writing is important enough to start a \"1/n\" Tweet thread, you've already demonstrated that Twitter is the wrong medium.<br /><br />The natural follow-on might be: what is Twitter good for? Here are my suggestions:<br /><br />Announcing a link to another, in-depth news resource, like a news article, blog post, whitepaper, etc.Offering a comment on an in-depth news resource, or replying to another person's announcement.Asking a poll question.Asking for help on a topic.Engaging in a short exchange with another user. Long exchanges on hot topics typically devolve into a confusing mess of messages and replies, that delivery of which Twitter has never really managed to figure out.<br />I understand the seduction of Twitter. I use it every day. However, when it really matters, blogging is preferable, followed by the other media I listed in point 3 above.<br /><br /><b>Update 0930 ET 27 Mar 2020:</b> I forgot to mention that in extenuating circumstances, like live-Tweeting an emergency, Twitter threads on significant matters are fine because the urgency of the situation and the convenience or plain logistical limitations of the situation make Twitter indispensable. I'm less thrilled by live-Tweeting in conferences, although I'm guilty of it in the past. I'd prefer a thoughtful wrap-up post following the event, which I did a lot before Twitter became popular.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

As Application Security Consultants at Veracode, we often receive questions from developers about unanticipated differences in findings between one static scan and another. Typically, developers will make some changes in their application between scans, but it is common for changes that appear unrelated to developer activity to be encountered. In this article, we’ll explore four of the reasons why this may occur.  \n1.

He was sent home, despite his requests to stay.

Employees can then use a single, strongly vetted identity to log in to those sites and services using a single set of credentials. It's better for security, and easier for employees.Now, 1Password Business customers can access 1Password with their Okta credentials, too. When they do, they can extend their Okta authentication policies to 1Password unlocks, which helps unify auditing, compliance, and reporting workflows.It also closes the gaps that SSO alone can't fill. SSO protects logins covered by SSO providers. 1Password protects so much more, like sensitive documents, payment cards, and developer secrets like API tokens and SSH keys. The move also simplifies signing in to 1Password for employees, so there's one less set of credentials to keep track of.<a href=\"/article/3691290/1password-integrates-with-okta-sso.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

No longer will it rely largely on prodding businesses and tech companies to voluntarily take basic security measures such as patching vulnerable systems to keep them updated.Instead, it now wants to establish baseline security requirements for businesses and tech companies and to fine those that don’t comply.It’s not just companies that use the systems who might eventually need to abide by the regulations. Companies that make and sell them, such as Microsoft, Apple, and others could be held accountable as well. Early indications are that the feds already have Microsoft in their crosshairs — they’ve warned the company that, at the moment, it doesn’t appear to be up to the task.<a href=\"/article/3690592/feds-to-microsoft-clean-up-your-security-act-or-else.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",

The malicious program appears to be developed and used by several members of a pro-Russia hacktivist group and is typically distributed inside decoy installers for legitimate software.Security researchers from threat intelligence firm Intel 471 first spotted AresLoader in November when it was advertised by a user with the monikers AiD Lock and DarkBLUP on Telegram and two well-known underground forums. AiD Lock is not a newcomer to malware development and was previously associated with the AiD Locker ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program as well as with a group called PHANTOM DEV or DeadXInject Hack.<a href=\"/article/3691633/russian-hacktivists-deploy-new-aresloader-malware-via-decoy-installers.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a>",
